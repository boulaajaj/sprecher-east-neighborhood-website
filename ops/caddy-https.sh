# HTTPS at Caddy (#235): the domain's HTTPS block sends HSTS, and plain HTTP to the server's IP
# (or to the domain, if a block serves it) redirects to the canonical HTTPS address instead of
# reaching the app.
#
# It only adds lines to /etc/caddy/Caddyfile, and refuses any other change:
#   - the HTTPS site block for the domain gets `import /etc/caddy/sprecher-east-hsts.caddy` (a copy
#     of ops/caddy/hsts.caddy, where max-age is set); www only redirects, so it needs none
#   - each site block that serves plain HTTP (`:80`, `http://<IP>`, `[::]:80`, `http://<domain>`)
#     gets `redir https://<domain>{uri} 308` as its first line. Caddy runs `redir` before
#     `reverse_proxy` in its default directive order, so the request never reaches the app. A
#     global `order` option could change that, so a Caddyfile with one is left alone.
# The canonical address is NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL. The new Caddyfile is validated, the old one
# backed up (written under a temporary name, compared, then renamed), and then replaced in one
# rename. Success means the domain sends the header and plain HTTP to the domain and the IP
# redirects permanently to https. Otherwise, or on any unexpected failure while changing, what
# was replaced comes back and the script fails. The check also runs when nothing needed changing,
# and when the layout wasn't recognised: then the IP still reaching the app fails the deploy.
# Results, like `curl -I`, are printed as annotations on the deploy run.
