# When the start settings PM2 has stored (arguments and working folder) differ from

# after, and the previous settings come back if it stops answering. That happens on the first run
# after #118 (arguments) and after #245 (folder: the `current` release link instead of the old
# checkout), or after any later change to them. Otherwise it is a plain reload.

# build, so the previous settings come back if the old code is still the one serving.
