# Puts a release built by GitHub Actions live (#245). The deploy workflow unpacks the build into
# $APP_DIR/releases/<name> and runs this script from there.
#
# Until the switch, nothing the visitors see changes: any failure stops the script and the
# previous release keeps serving. The steps:
#   1. check the release fits this server (Node version, public settings, native modules)
#   2. link the shared .env.local, data/ and public/media into it
#   3. back up the data (ops/backup.sh pre-deploy), then run the database migrations
#   4. drop the pages prerendered in CI, whose database was empty: each renders from the live
#      database on its first visit, then is cached as usual
#   5. switch the `current` link atomically and reload the app under PM2 (ops/restart-app.sh)
#   6. check the site answers through Caddy with this release's build; if not, switch back
#   7. refresh the backup job and the Caddy limits, and keep the newest $KEEP_RELEASES releases
#
# The first run moves the app from the old checkout in $APP_DIR to `current`; the checkout stays
# untouched as the way back (ops/README.md, "Releases").
