 * 1. No mail to addresses the visitor typed in: a form email whose recipients come from the
 *    submission (e.g. a confirmation to "{{email}}") would let anyone make the site send mail
 *    to arbitrary addresses, including comma-separated lists. Those emails are dropped; emails
 *    to recipients the admin configured (e.g. info@) still go out. Re-enabling visitor
 *    confirmations is an owner decision (needs spam protection, see #112).
 * 2. A From filled from the submission is replaced by the SMTP default sender.
 * 3. A Reply-To filled from the submission (e.g. "{{email}}" on the owner notification) is kept
 *    only if it is exactly one plain address; otherwise it falls back to the From address, so a
 *    list or junk (or a CR/LF header injection) can't send the owner's reply elsewhere. The
 *    visitor's input stays in the body.
