/**
 * Refuses a new email on the requester's own account unless the change came through the site's
 * confirm-by-link flow (#555). Payload sends a verification link only when an account is created,
 * so without this an open session (an unlocked computer, a stolen cookie) could point the account
 * at any address through `PATCH /api/users/<id>`, GraphQL or `/admin`, and it would stay marked
 * verified. The reset email and the contact form's account check both trust that mark.
 *
 * Not affected: an admin changing another account's email, new accounts, server code that runs
 * without a user (the seed), and requests that send the email it already has. Payload reads the
 * email before this hook runs, so the hook throws rather than strips it.
