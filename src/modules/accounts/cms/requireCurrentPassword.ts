/**
 * Refuses a new password on the requester's own account unless the current password was checked
 * just before (#233). Without it, an open session (an unlocked computer, a stolen cookie) could
 * still set one through `PATCH /api/users/<id>`, GraphQL or `/admin`. The account page's action
 * marks the confirmed change in the request context, which no HTTP caller can set.
 *
 * Not affected: an admin setting another account's password, new accounts, server code that runs
 * without a user (the seed), and Payload's forgot and reset password, which don't run `update`.
 * Payload reads the password before this hook runs, so the hook throws rather than strips it.
