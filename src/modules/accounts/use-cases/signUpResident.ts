 * answered like a new one, and a failure is logged rather than shown, as for a reset link (#269),
 * so no answer says whether an account exists (docs/guidelines/security.md).
 *
 * When that account isn't verified yet, its link is sent again, up to the resend cap (#289),
 * after the answer, so the reply takes no longer for it.
