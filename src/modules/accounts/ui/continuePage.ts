/**
 * The page the sign-in callback answers once the person is signed in (#188): it sends them on to
 * `path` itself, rather than with a redirect. The provider sent the browser back with a cross-site
 * navigation, and a redirect would carry that on, so the next page's request would count as
 * cross-site and Payload's CSRF check would ignore the new sign-in cookie. A page on this site
 * that moves on (a meta refresh, or the link) makes the next request same-origin. No script.
 * `path` is one of the module's own paths, never input.
