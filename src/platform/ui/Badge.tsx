/*
 * A short label, such as a post's or an event's category (#418). `category` is the pill on cards
 * and plain pages: primary-strong on the primary tint, which the theme contract checks at 4.5:1
 * on the page, a surface and a card (the plain primary text it had was 3.9 to 4.5:1). `on-image`
 * sits on a photo, on a scrim of its own (60%), so it passes even over white (`SCRIM_PAIRS`).
 * `status` marks a state the reader must not miss, such as a cancelled event (#122):
 * destructive-strong on the destructive tint, which the contract checks like `Alert`'s error tone
 * (`TINTED_PAIRS`). Its words say the state, and an icon may go before them, so colour is never
 * the only signal. `official` marks an official meeting (#122): the category pill's checked pair
 * (primary-strong on the primary tint), set apart by its border, weight and icon rather than a
 * new colour, so it reads as distinct but calm. Three tones mark how certain a step is, for the
 * editorial timeline (#507), each with its own words: `current` (primary-foreground on the primary
 * fill, the button pair) for what's next; `caution` (warning-strong on the warning tint, `Alert`'s
 * warning pair) for what depends on something else; `neutral` (muted-foreground on muted) for what
 * is expected later. Every pair is one the theme contract checks.
