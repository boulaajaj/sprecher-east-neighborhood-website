# AGENTS.md — Sprecher East website

This file is the repository's own memory of **how work is done here**, and the entry point for
everyone who changes it: AI agents and humans. The supported agents are Claude Code (primary) and
Codex ([Tool adapters](#tool-adapters)). Start here; it links to everything else.

It does not depend on any tool's private memory. If a tool's memory, a chat instruction, or
another doc in this repo conflicts with this file, **this file wins**. To change the rules,
change this file through the same workflow below.

## Ground rules

- **The name is "Sprecher East"**: never "SENA", "SE" or another abbreviation.
- **The site is unofficial and AI-assisted**, and says so. Content is factual and inclusive.
- **The repo is public.** Never commit secrets or real personal data (see
  [security](docs/guidelines/security.md)).
- **Native first, then plugins, then our code.** Before building a feature, check what Payload,
  Next.js and React do natively, then official plugins, then well-established free open-source
  ones. Write custom code only when none fits, and record what each step found on the issue.
  It's a guide for judgment: real trade-offs go to the owner
  ([the ladder](docs/guidelines/development.md#native-first-then-plugins-then-our-code)).

## The only way code reaches `main` and production

Merging code changes to `main` deploys them to production automatically
(`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). So every change, however small, follows these five steps:

1. **Issue first.** Start from a GitHub issue created with one of the issue forms in
   `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. It describes the problem (or goal) and acceptance criteria.
   Labels:
   - exactly one **type**: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `tech-debt`, or `process`
   - one or more **areas**, such as `frontend`, `cms`, `auth`, `ci`, `infra`, or `dependencies`
   - one **priority**: `priority: high`, `priority: medium`, or `priority: low`

   The issue forms apply these automatically (`.github/workflows/issue-labels.yml`). The
   allowed values live in one place: `.github/label-policy.json`.

2. **Branch and pull request.** Work on a branch, never on `main`. Open a PR that:
   - links the issue with a closing keyword (`Closes #123`), or with `Part of #123` when an
     issue needs several PRs (the last one uses `Closes`)
   - fills in every section of `.github/pull_request_template.md`: **What changed**,
     **Why**, **How**, **How to test**, **Risk & rollback**
   - **sits on a native GitHub stack when it depends on another open PR**: its base is the
     branch of the PR below, and the PRs are joined in a stack so GitHub enforces the order they
     merge in. A merge order written in a description or a message is never enough
     ([`stacked-prs`](.agents/skills/stacked-prs/SKILL.md)).

3. **Review.** Every PR is reviewed before merge:
   - an **independent review** by a reviewer that did not write the change (a separate agent
     session following [`pr-review`](.agents/skills/pr-review/SKILL.md), or a human), posted
     on the PR, ending with the verdict **Ready to merge**
   - every review comment answered and its conversation resolved

   Changes to the process itself are policy changes, and the review must call them out
   explicitly. That covers `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/`, `docs/guidelines/`, `docs/roles/`,
   `.github/`, and the Claude Code adapter (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`). A policy change
   the owner (Amine) asked for follows the normal path. Agents file issues through his account,
   so an issue alone doesn't show he asked: the issue or PR quotes his words, with the date and
   where he said them, and the reviewer checks the change stays within that quote. A policy
   change an agent proposes on its own is labeled `needs owner` when it's filed, and waits for
   him.

4. **Everything green.** All required checks pass before merge: `Type-check & Build`,
   `Prettier`, `ESLint`, `Dependency Audit`, and `PR Policy` (which verifies steps 1–2).
   Never bypass a failing or missing check. In a stack, every PR must be green on its own.

   Dependabot PRs are exempt from the issue and description rules only. They still need green
   checks and a review before they merge. Whoever picks one up (usually the ops lead) owns it and
   merges it.

5. **Merge, then CI/CD takes over.** The agent that owns the PR merges it (squash merge) once steps
   3 and 4 are done: every required check passes on the PR's current head, the review of that head
   says **Ready to merge**, and no conversation is open. A review of an earlier head still counts
   only when the head changed because a PR below it merged (or `main` moved) and the PR's own diff
   is unchanged. If a PR below changed after the review, this PR needs a new review even when its
   own diff didn't change; it can be short, checking this PR against what changed below. The owner
   doesn't need to be involved, but he can merge, hold or revert anything himself. A PR labeled
   `needs owner`, or one whose issue is, waits for him: he merges it or removes the label. A stack
   merges one layer at a time from the bottom. Before the next layer, wait for its checks on its
   rebased head and, if the merge started a deploy, for the deploy to succeed
   ([`change-workflow`](.agents/skills/change-workflow/SKILL.md), step 6). The deploy workflow ships
   `main` to the VPS. After the merge, the linked issue is closed and gets a comment summarizing how
   it was fixed (`.github/workflows/issue-fix-summary.yml`).

### Never

- Never push to `main` directly, and never merge a PR whose checks or review aren't done.
- Never bypass a rule: no `--admin`, no `bypass_rules: true`, no other ruleset bypass, even when
  the account you're using has admin rights.
- Never remove the `needs owner` label yourself. If you find the owner's words later, quote them on
  the PR and leave the label for him.
- **Never change code on the server.** No editing files in `/var/www/sprecher-east`, no
  `git apply` or hotfixes over SSH. If production is broken, fix or revert through a PR.
- Never commit secrets (`.env.local`, keys, tokens, passwords).
- Never hand over dependent PRs as separate PRs with a merge order in prose. Stack them.

### Server configuration is not code — but it is still tracked

Some things live only on the servers: `.env.local`, the Caddy config, PM2, DNS records, and
third-party dashboards (Mailgun, Porkbun, Hostinger). Before changing any of them, open an issue
labeled `infra`. Say what will change and why, and how to roll it back. Afterwards, comment
on that issue with what was actually changed. Never put secret values in the issue.

### How GitHub enforces this

The `main` ruleset requires a pull request, the five checks above, and resolved conversations.
It also blocks force pushes and deletion. Stacks enforce the merge order of dependent PRs.
Agents currently work through the owner's GitHub account, which has admin rights, so GitHub
can't technically stop an agent from bypassing the ruleset. Until agents have their own GitHub
identity (#106), the no-bypass rule depends on every agent following this file and merging with
rules enforced (`bypass_rules: false`).

## Skills: how to do things

Procedures are [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io): a folder in `.agents/skills/` with a
`SKILL.md` that starts with a `name` and a `description`. Codex loads them from there, Claude Code
through the pointers in `.claude/skills/`, and a human reads them as plain Markdown.

## Where knowledge lives

Durable knowledge about this project lives in this repository and changes through the workflow
above. Not in a tool's private memory, a chat, or loose notes.

- Why the site exists and what comes next go in `docs/product/` (vision and roadmap).
- How work is planned and tracked goes in `docs/process/`.
- A rule everyone follows on every change goes in this file.
- A convention goes in a guideline in `docs/guidelines/`.
- A procedure goes in a skill in `.agents/skills/`.
- What a role focuses on and checks goes in its role guide in `docs/roles/`.
- A fact about the system goes in `docs/project.md` or `docs/architecture/`; the reason behind a
  decision goes in a decision record (`docs/architecture/decisions/`).

Write all of these for any agent and any human: no tool-specific commands or model names. Keep
each file under 250 lines.

## Tool adapters

The repo supports two agents: **Claude Code**, the primary one, and **Codex**. Other tools aren't
supported, and the repo doesn't keep a file for each tool.

- **Codex** reads this file and `.agents/skills/` itself. It needs nothing else.
- **Claude Code** needs a thin adapter: `CLAUDE.md`, which imports this file and the core
  references, and `.claude/`. `.claude/` holds a pointer to each skill in `.agents/skills/`
  (`simplify` is Claude Code's name for `self-review`), plus the subagents for the role guides.

An adapter holds only what is specific to its tool. Never put a rule, procedure or fact only in an
adapter: Codex wouldn't see it.
