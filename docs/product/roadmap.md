# Roadmap

What the site is working toward, in order. The [vision](vision.md) says why. **GitHub holds the
live status:**

- **Milestones:** dated outcomes.
- **Epics:** issues labeled `epic`, with their sub-issues.
- **[The project board](https://github.com/users/boulaajaj/projects/2):** the current sprint. It's
  private, so only the owner's account can open it.

This file lists only the milestones and their epics, as a snapshot. GitHub is the source: this
command prints the open epics by milestone, and the tables below must match it. Update the tables
when an epic is added, rescheduled or finished, not as work moves. How the levels fit together is in
[how we work](../process/project-management.md).

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?labels=epic&state=open&per_page=100" \
  -q 'sort_by(.milestone.due_on // "9999") | .[] | "\(.milestone.title // "No milestone")\t#\(.number) \(.title)"'
```

## Milestone 1: Ready for neighbors (due 2026-11-30)

[Milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/boulaajaj/sprecher-east-neighborhood-website/milestone/1)

The site is useful and inviting enough to promote across the neighborhood.

New ideas start as GitHub issues: a new capability as an epic, anything smaller under the epic it
belongs to. An epic gets a milestone when it's planned.
