# 0017: One message catalog in code, durations from the real settings

- **Date:** 2026-11-01
- **Status:** Accepted

## Context

The messages residents read after sending a form were long, wrote times by hand ("24 hours", "one
hour") next to the setting that decides them, and could drift from it. The owner (2026-11-01,
voice session with Claude, quoted on #551): the copy must sound like "a human who understands the
human experience… in this neighborhood specifically", durations must come from the real settings,
and the messages should live in one place, in code, so they can be translated later.

Native first (#551): Payload's CMS holds editor content, not interface text tied to security
behavior; `Intl` formats durations; no i18n library is needed for one language yet.

## Decision

- `src/platform/lib/messages/` is the one catalog: typed keys, whole sentences, `{blank}` values
  filled by `message(key, values)`. A missing value throws.
- `formatDuration()` turns a setting into words ("an hour", "a day"). Link lifetimes are constants
  (`CONFIRMATION_LINK_LIFETIME_MS`, `RESET_LINK_LIFETIME_MS`) used by the link and by its message.
- A test fails when a catalog sentence hard-codes a time or runs past 30 words.
- The contact form's own thank-you heading stays in the CMS (the form's `confirmationMessage`).

## Consequences

Changing a lifetime changes the message with it. Translating means replacing sentences, not
fragments. Messages not yet moved (#551, next PRs) still live next to their components.
