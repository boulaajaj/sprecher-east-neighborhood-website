# Roles

Role guides describe a focus area of the work on this site: its mission, what good looks like, and
its checklists. Any agent, or any human, can take on a role by reading its guide; nothing here
depends on a particular tool or model.

[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), the [guidelines](../guidelines/README.md) and
[`docs/architecture/`](../architecture/README.md) win wherever a role guide disagrees with them. If
you find a disagreement, fix the role guide in the same PR.

Role guides are policy files, as they were when they lived in `.claude/agents/`: a PR that changes
one gets the owner's explicit sign-off ([`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), step 3).

## Using a role from your tool

- **Claude Code** registers each role as a subagent in `.claude/agents/<role>.md`. Those files only
  hold Claude Code settings and point here.
- **Other tools** that support custom agents can do the same: a short adapter that points to the
  guide, listed under [Tool adapters](../../AGENTS.md#tool-adapters). Without one, read the guide
  for the role you're working in.

## Sprint retrospective (every role)

### Practice

At the end of each sprint, the team holds a retrospective. Everyone working in a role takes part
by logging observations throughout the sprint.

### What to Track

During every work session, note anything that should be discussed at retro:

- **Issues encountered**: Bugs, broken workflows, tooling problems, unclear requirements
- **Friction points**: Tasks that took longer than expected and why
- **Feedback received**: Input from residents, neighbors, or Amine (project lead)
- **Architectural impacts**: Decisions or events that caused significant rework or pivots
- **Incomplete work**: Tasks left undone and the reason (blocked, deprioritized, out of scope)
- **Wins**: Things that went well, patterns worth repeating, tools that helped

### Where to Log

Append observations to the shared sprint retro file: `docs/memory/retro/sprint-{N}.md`

Entry format:

```markdown
### [Date] — [Role]

- **Observation**: What happened
- **Impact**: How it affected the work
- **Recommendation**: What to change or continue
```

### Cadence

- **Every session**: Log observations to the retro file before ending work
- **Weekly review**: Amine reviews the retro file at end of week
- **Biweekly retrospective**: Full team retro — review all observations, decide on changes, update processes
