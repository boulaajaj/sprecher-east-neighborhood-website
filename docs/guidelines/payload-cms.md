# Payload CMS v3 Patterns

Technical patterns for working with Payload CMS v3 Website Template in this codebase.

## Collections

Collection configs live in the owning module's `cms/` folder (for example
`src/modules/news/cms/posts.ts`), exported from its `cms.ts`; the shared `media` collection is
`src/platform/payload/media.ts` ([architecture](../architecture/README.md#where-does-it-go)).
Every collection with public content uses:

- `access: draftContentAccess` from `src/platform/payload/draftContentAccess.ts` (published-only reads for non-staff, staff-only writes and version history; see [`security.md`](security.md))
- `versions: { drafts: true }` for draft/publish workflow (adds `_status` field)
- `defaultPopulate` to limit fields returned in relationship queries (e.g., `{ title: true, slug: true }`)
- `hooks.afterChange` for revalidation (pattern: check `context.disableRevalidate` guard first)

Slug fields use Payload's built-in `slugField()` (`import { slugField } from 'payload'`).

## Blocks

A page-builder block belongs to a module and has four parts
([decision 0013](../architecture/decisions/0013-cms-content-through-mappers.md)):

- the Payload `Block` config (`slug`, `interfaceName`, `fields`) in the module's `cms/`, for
  example `src/modules/site/cms/callToActionBlock.ts`
- its plain props type in the module's `domain/` (`CallToActionBlockProps`)
- the mapper `to…Props` in the module's `data/mappers.ts`, which turns the stored block into those
  props; the page's use case calls it for `site`'s own blocks, and the block registry for blocks
  other modules own
- the React component taking those props, in the module's `ui/` and exported from its
  `server.ts`, for example `src/modules/site/ui/CallToActionBlock.tsx`

Blocks built before 0013 still take the generated block type until they move.

**IMPORTANT**: Adding a new block requires THREE registration steps:

1. Add the block config to the Pages layout: `SITE_LAYOUT_BLOCKS` in `src/modules/site/cms/layoutBlocks.ts` for a `site` block, or the `layoutBlocks` that `src/payload.config.ts` passes to `createPagesCollection` for another module's block (the form block from `contact`, the "this week" strip from `events`)
2. Add a `case` for its `blockType` to `renderBlock` in `src/modules/site/ui/RenderBlocks.tsx`
3. Add the component to the block registry, `pageBlocks` in `src/app/(frontend)/[slug]/pageBlocks.tsx`

Without step 1 editors can't add the block. Once the types are regenerated, a missing step 2 or 3
fails `tsc`.

Page-builder blocks: `archive`, `content`, `cta`, `eventsThisWeek` (from `events`), `formBlock`,
`mediaBlock`. Blocks inside rich text (`src/platform/richtext/`): `banner`, `code`, `mediaBlock`.

## Heroes

Hero components live in `src/modules/site/ui/`. Four types: `highImpact`, `mediumImpact`, `lowImpact`, `none`.

`toPageHeroProps` in `src/modules/site/data/mappers.ts` maps the `type` field and the hero's fields to `PageHeroProps` (`src/modules/site/domain/hero.ts`, [decision 0013](../architecture/decisions/0013-cms-content-through-mappers.md)), and `getPageBySlug` returns the hero mapped. Hero config fields are defined in `src/modules/site/cms/hero.ts` as a reusable field group.

**Two kinds of hero components:**

- **CMS heroes** (`PageHero` in `src/modules/site/ui/PageHero.tsx`, variants `high`, `medium`, `low`) — chosen with the `src/modules/site/cms/hero.ts` type selector; the page draws `PageHero` with the mapped props. Used by Pages via the layout builder.
- **Standalone heroes** (the post and event pages' `PageHeader · image`, from `src/platform/ui/`, with props from `postHeaderProps` in `src/modules/news/ui/` and `eventHeaderProps` in `src/modules/events/ui/`) — used directly by their detail pages, NOT registered in the CMS hero config. These are hardcoded per-collection detail pages and don't need CMS selection.

## Hooks

Shared server-side hooks are in `src/platform/payload/`:

- `populatePublishedAt.ts` — Sets `publishedAt` on create if not set

Collection-specific hooks (e.g., `revalidatePage`, `revalidatePost`, `revalidateRedirects`) live in the owning module's `cms/` folder.

**Hook rules**:

- Always accept and pass `req` from hook args
- Guard revalidation with `if (context.disableRevalidate) return` to prevent loops
- Use `revalidatePath()` for paths, and expire cache tags with `expireCacheTag()` from `src/platform/payload/expireCacheTag.ts` rather than `revalidateTag()` (`docs/project.md`, Known Gotchas)

## Fields

Reusable field helpers:

- `src/modules/site/cms/link.ts` — `link()` creates a group field with `type` (reference/custom), `label`, `url`, `reference`, `newTab`, `appearance`
- `src/modules/site/cms/linkGroup.ts` — `linkGroup()` creates an array of link fields
- `src/platform/payload/defaultLexical.ts` — Standard Lexical editor config with toolbar features

## SEO Plugin Type Gap

Payload plugins (like `@payloadcms/plugin-seo`) can add fields at runtime that aren't reflected in generated types. When accessing plugin-injected fields, use safe type assertions and comment why. When plugin fields conflict with generic type parameters (e.g., `CollectionConfig<'posts'>`), drop the generic. Since #196 the SEO fields are typed (Pages, Posts and Events build their own SEO tab from the plugin's fields), so no code needs such an assertion today.

## Migrations

Migrations are auto-generated by `npx payload migrate:create` and excluded from CodeRabbit review. After generating, review for data safety — especially when tightening constraints (nullable → NOT NULL) or dropping/recreating referenced tables.

`src/payload-types.ts` is regenerated automatically only under `next dev` (`typescript.autoGenerate` in `payload.config.ts`). Payload CLI commands (`migrate`, `migrate:create`, seeding) no longer rewrite it, so after any schema change run `npm run generate:types` and commit the file. This keeps the deploy's `payload migrate` from dirtying the server checkout (#115).

## Config Registration

`payload.config.ts` has `collections` and `globals` arrays. New collections/globals must be added there or Payload won't see them.

## Seed Data

Seed scripts in `src/endpoints/seed/`:

- Use `RequiredDataFromCollectionSlug<'collectionSlug'>` for type safety
- Always set `_status: 'published'` for draft-enabled collections
- Use Lexical helpers from `src/endpoints/seed/helpers/lexical.ts`: `root()`, `heading()`, `p()`, `paragraph()`, `text()`, `boldText()`, `linkNode()`
- Set `context: { disableRevalidate: true }` when creating seed docs to avoid revalidation errors
- Use `@example.com` domain for all seed email addresses
