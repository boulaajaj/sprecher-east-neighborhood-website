# Security Guidelines

## Agent Security Rules (MUST follow during development)

### Before adding any new package

1. Check the package on npm — look at weekly downloads, last publish date, and maintainer count
2. Prefer packages that are widely used (>1M weekly downloads) and actively maintained (<6 months since last publish)
3. Run `npm audit` after every `npm install` — if new vulnerabilities appear, fix them before committing
4. Avoid packages with known CVEs. If a CVE exists, check if a patched version is available first
5. Prefer built-in Node.js/Next.js features over third-party packages when possible (fewer deps = smaller attack surface)

### When writing code

- Never use `eval()`, `Function()` constructor, or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` directly — use safe shared wrappers instead (e.g., `JsonLd` component for structured data). Input that seems trusted today can become untrusted as the codebase evolves.
- Never interpolate user input into SQL, shell commands, or URLs — always use parameterized/template-safe methods
- Validate and sanitize all user input at system boundaries (API routes, form handlers)
- Use `encodeURIComponent()` when building URLs from user input
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, API keys, PII) — even in dev
- Use `overrideAccess: true` only in server-side Payload reads (never expose raw Payload queries to the client)
- Set appropriate CORS headers on API routes
- Never disable TypeScript strict checks or ESLint security rules to make code compile

### No PII in source code

- Never hardcode real email addresses, phone numbers, or personal names in source files
- Use environment variables for all email addresses (sender, recipient, reply-to)
- `.env.local.example` must use placeholder values (`you@example.com`, `no-reply@example.com`) — never real addresses
- Console logs must never include user-submitted PII (names, emails, addresses) — log only non-identifying metadata (subject, message length, timestamp)
- Sanitize user input before placing it in email headers — strip CR/LF and control characters to prevent header injection
- When validating select/dropdown values server-side, whitelist the allowed values — never trust client-submitted strings
- Seed data passwords must use `process.env.SEED_PASSWORD || crypto.randomUUID()` — never hardcode passwords like `'password'`
- All seed email addresses must use `@example.com` domain — never use real addresses

### When handling auth and sessions

- `PAYLOAD_SECRET` must be a strong random string (32+ chars) for JWT signing
- Payload handles session cookies natively via httpOnly JWT cookies
- Payload's built-in access control protects routes and data. Use the correct read access per collection type: `authenticatedOrPublished` for draft-enabled content (shows drafts to admins/editors, published to everyone else), `anyone` for public utility collections (Categories, Media, TeamMembers) that have no draft workflow.
- Never store tokens or secrets in localStorage — use httpOnly cookies (Payload handles this)
- Never expose user roles or permissions in client-side JavaScript beyond what's needed for UI
- **Never surface raw backend errors on auth endpoints** — login, password reset, and registration must show fixed generic messages to prevent account enumeration and information leakage. Log raw errors server-side for debugging, never render them in the UI.
- **RBAC is enforced via `src/platform/payload/roles.ts`**: All access control uses role-based functions (`isAdmin`, `isAdminOrEditor`, `isAdminOrSelf`, `isAdminFieldAccess`, `isAdminOrEditorFieldAccess`). The old `authenticated.ts` and `authenticatedSelf.ts` files are deleted — never recreate flat access checks.
- **Four roles**: `admin` (full access), `editor` (content CRUD, admin panel), `resident` (read published, own profile only), `agent` (an automated account: reads published content and suggests events and posts through its MCP key, #336). Default for new users is `resident`. Role checks trust only principals from `users` (`ACCOUNTS_COLLECTION`): an MCP API key can also authenticate a REST request as the key document itself, and it then counts as signed out, even where its id matches an account's.
- **Users collection access**: `admin: isAdminOrEditorBoolean`, `create/delete/unlock: isAdmin`, `read/update: isAdminOrSelf`. The role field has field-level access (`isAdminFieldAccess`) so only admins can assign roles.
- **Agent access over MCP** (#336): agents reach the CMS only at `/api/mcp`, through Payload's official MCP plugin (`src/modules/agents/cms/mcp.ts`). The owner asked for it (2026-10-24, Claude Code session, quoted on #336). Each request carries an API key that acts as one `agent` account, so collection access, not just the key's checkboxes, decides what it may do: find published events, posts and categories; suggest events and posts with the `submitSuggestion` tool (always an unpublished `suggested` draft, as the agent, `overrideAccess: false`; it links existing categories only, and the draft's image is a category's default image from the site's own media, never an upload, #363); add items for editors to its run with `reportItem`, which never changes the content it points at; create, read and update its own `agent-runs`. The plugin's raw create is off for events and posts, and every tool argument has a size cap ([agent access](../architecture/agent-access.md)). It can never update, publish or delete content, nor read `users` or `form-submissions`. Every find answer is rebuilt from an allowlist (`AGENT_VIEWS` in `src/modules/agents/cms/agentViews.ts`, checked against the generated types), so no author, email or rich text reaches the model. A key stops working if its account is no longer an agent. Each connection gets 120 requests a minute, counted before the key is looked up, and each key 60 (`MCP_LIMITS`), then 429. An agent's review items are separate documents it can't change, and its run's identity can't be rewritten after the run starts. Agent accounts can't sign in with a password (`noPasswordSignInForAgents`), so the key, which an admin can delete, is their only credential. Keys are created in Admin and never written to the repo or an issue. Caddy caps `/api/mcp` request bodies at 256 KB with the form endpoints (#124).
- **Sign-up** (#187): `POST /api/users` stays admin-only. Visitors sign up only through the accounts module's server action, which calls the Local API `create` with `overrideAccess: true` and builds the data itself: the role is always `resident`, and nothing else the visitor sends reaches the account. Before creating it, the action runs the same Turnstile robot check as the contact form and checks in-memory limits (5 attempts per connection and 20 site-wide per hour, `SIGN_UP_LIMITS`). `auth.verify` is on, so a new account can't sign in until Payload's one-time link is opened, and `noResetEmailWhileUnverified` sends it no reset email until then. If the verification email fails, the action deletes the unverified account it just stored, so the address isn't stuck. Accounts an admin creates in `/admin` also start unverified and get the link. Sign-up and verification answer the same whether or not an account uses the email.
- **Forgot password** (#282): only the site's `/forgot-password` server action reaches Payload's `forgotPassword`. It runs the same guard as sign-up (`createRequestGuard`: 5 requests per connection, the Turnstile robot check, 30 site-wide per hour, `RESET_REQUEST_LIMITS`), then answers at once and runs Payload in Next's `after()`, so an existing and an unknown email take the same time. `forgotPasswordFromSiteOnly` refuses the operation over REST and GraphQL (403 for every email), and `/admin/forgot` redirects to the site's page.
- **Site-wide limits on public account forms** (#292): sign-up and forgot password each count requests site-wide per hour, once they pass the robot check, to protect the email quota. Someone who gets that many requests past the robot check in an hour blocks the form for everyone until the hour is up; the owner accepted that trade-off (2026-10-23). The per-connection limit is counted before the robot check. Change the limits only in `src/modules/accounts/domain/requestLimits.ts`, and update this line with them.
- **Content collections** (Pages, Posts, Events, FAQ, Resources): use the shared `draftContentAccess` from `src/platform/payload/draftContentAccess.ts` (`create/update/readVersions: isAdminOrEditor`, `delete: isAdmin`, `read: authenticatedOrPublished`). Never copy its fields into a collection. Posts and Events use `suggestibleContentAccess` from the same file: the same, except that an agent may also `create`. `holdSuggestions` stores whatever a non-staff account creates as an unpublished draft with review status `suggested`, and requires its source (#123).
- **Utility collections** (Categories, Media, TeamMembers): `create/update: isAdminOrEditor`, `delete: isAdmin`, `read: anyone`. TeamMembers' `email` field is field-level `read: isAdminOrEditorFieldAccess`, so it never reaches the public API.
- **Plugin collections**: Search → `update/delete: isAdminOrEditor` (staff can reindex; the plugin's own sync bypasses access). Media folders → `isAdminOrEditor` for all ops. Redirects → `isAdmin` for all ops. Forms → `anyone` for read (visitors need the field definitions to fill a form in; with restricted read the public contact form rendered empty), `isAdminOrEditor` for create/update, `isAdmin` for delete; the `emails` field (recipients, reply-to, templates) is field-level `isAdminOrEditorFieldAccess`. Form submissions → `isAdmin` for read/update/delete, `anyone` for create (public form submissions). MCP API keys (`payload-mcp-api-keys`) → `isAdmin` for all ops, through `overrideApiKeyCollection`; a key's `user` must be an `agent` account.
- **Audit access control when adding new collections**: Every new collection must use role-based access from `src/platform/payload/roles.ts`. Never use a flat `authenticated` check.
- **Set every operation explicitly**: Payload's default for an operation you leave out is "any signed-in user". A collection must set `read`, `create`, `update` and `delete`, plus `readVersions` when it has versions and `unlock` when it has logins; a global sets `read` and `update`, plus `readVersions` with versions. Jobs set `jobs.access` (`queue`, `cancel`: staff; `run`: admins). This includes plugin and Payload collections where they can be overridden. `src/platform/payload/accessPolicy.test.ts` checks the whole config; update its policy table when access changes on purpose.
- **A field only the server sets refuses writes too** (#299): `hidden: true` hides a field from reads only, and Payload still accepts writes to it from the API. Give it `access: serverOnlyFieldAccess` from `src/platform/payload/roles.ts` (create, update and read all refused), not just `hidden: true`. The server writes it with `overrideAccess: true` or the database adapter. On a collection the public can create, a `beforeChange` hook also overwrites it on create (as `recordSenderEmail` does for `heldEmails`). `accessPolicy.test.ts` fails when a hidden field lets anyone write it, and `src/payload.config.protectedFields.test.ts` sends the writes a visitor or resident could try.
- **Custom routes check the role, not just sign-in**: a route under `src/app/` that changes data or reveals drafts (for example `/next/seed`, `/next/preview`) must check the role with the helpers in `src/platform/payload/roles.ts` and have a test that a resident is refused.
- **When changing roles or adding new roles**: Update `src/platform/payload/roles.ts`, the `role` field options in Users collection (`src/modules/accounts/cms/users.ts`), `ROLES` and the `Role` type (`src/platform/lib/roles.ts`), and generate a migration.

### Secrets management

- All secrets go in `.env.local` (gitignored, never committed)
- System-level env vars (like `HOSTINGER_API_KEY`) are set in the OS, not in files
- Never hardcode API keys, passwords, or tokens in source code
- Use `process.env.VAR_NAME` to access secrets at runtime
- Before every commit, check staged files for accidental secrets (API keys, passwords, connection strings)
- Never commit `.env.local`, SSH private keys, or any other file holding a secret. Secret scanning and push protection block most pushes that contain one, but don't rely on them

## Dependency Security Guardrails

Four layers of protection against vulnerable dependencies:

1. **Agent rules** (during development): Check packages before installing, run audit after install, fix before committing
2. **Pre-commit hook** (local): `npm audit --audit-level=high --omit=dev` warns if production deps have high/critical vulnerabilities
3. **CI pipeline** (PR gate): `npm audit --audit-level=high --omit=dev` blocks merging if any high/critical production vulnerabilities are found
4. **Dependabot** (ongoing): Weekly scans with grouped PRs — patches batched together, majors get individual PRs

When fixing transitive vulnerabilities:

- Use `overrides` in package.json scoped to the parent package (not global overrides)
- Dismiss unfixable alerts with a clear comment explaining why (e.g., dev-only, no upstream fix available)
- Document any overrides in PR description so reviewers understand the tradeoff

## Infrastructure Security

- SSH key-based auth only on VPS (no password auth)
- Caddy handles SSL/TLS automatically when domain is configured
- PM2 runs the app as a managed process (auto-restart on crash)
- GitHub Actions secrets store VPS credentials (never in code)
- **NEVER overwrite `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`** — always read it first, then ADD new server blocks. The automated exceptions run by every deploy, each refusing any edit that changes more than its own: `ops/caddy-limits.sh` adds an `import` line inside the site blocks that proxy to the app (#124); `ops/caddy-https.sh` adds an HSTS `import` line to the domain's HTTPS block and a `redir` line to the site blocks that serve plain HTTP (#235)
- Always back up before editing: `cp /etc/caddy/Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile.bak`
- Always validate before reloading: `caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile && systemctl reload caddy`
- Live domains (`sprechereast.com`, `www.sprechereast.com`) must NEVER be removed from the Caddyfile
