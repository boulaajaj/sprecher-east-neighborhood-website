# Component set: shared components

Part of the [UI inventory](inventory.md) (#170), for epic #163.

To see every component and variant at once, run `npm run dev` and open `/dev/gallery`
(`src/app/(frontend)/dev/gallery/`, development only, #466).

> **Status: approved.** The owner approved this set on 2026-10-21, with the merges he asked for
> that day (fewer components, each composed from the others, never a second button). Components
> are built in the order below, each in its own issue under epic #163.

The set comes from the [element tables](inventory.md#the-files): every element maps to exactly one
component and variant ([coverage check](component-set-modules.md#coverage)). This page covers the
shared components; [component-set-modules.md](component-set-modules.md) covers the components that
belong to one business area, what isn't needed yet, and the coverage table.

## Rules every component follows

- **Where:** shared primitives in `src/platform/ui/`, the rich-text renderer in
  `src/platform/richtext/`, area components in a module's `ui/`
  ([architecture](../architecture/README.md#where-does-it-go)). One component per file, under 250
  lines.
- **Variants with `cva`**, named by purpose (`primary`, `muted`), never by colour. Colours come
  from semantic tokens only ([rule 9](../architecture/README.md#dependency-rules)).
- **Plain typed props.** No component imports Payload; it gets `ImageRef`, `RichTextValue` or the
  module's own types. CMS links go through one `resolveLink()` mapper into a `ResolvedLink`
  (`href`, `label`, `external`, `appearance`; the type is in `src/platform/lib/content.ts`).
- **Proven libraries behind our API:** Radix for behaviour (select, checkbox, dialog),
  react-hook-form with Zod for forms (epic #163).
- **Composition over flags:** `Card` and `Field` are built from small parts; looks are variants,
  not booleans.
- **One implementation per element.** `Button` is the only thing that draws a button: a form's
  submit, a card's action, "Load more", a toast's action and the copy button all place a `Button`.
  `Link` only ever looks like text. A component that would differ from another only in a few
  classes becomes a variant of it instead.
- **Accessible by default:** focus ring, 44 px touch targets on phones, labels linked to controls,
  errors announced, `aria-current` on the current page.

Each group below links its generated page: every component with its props, variants and the
modules and routes that import it (`npm run docs:generate`, checked by `npm run docs:check`, #718).
The page you are reading keeps what code cannot say. Which inventory element each component covers is
in the [coverage check](component-set-modules.md#coverage).

## Actions

Components: [actions](../reference/components/actions.md).

**The skip link (L1)** is `Button · primary` with `href="#main"`, hidden until it has focus: it
looks like a button, so it is one.

**`Button · {appearance}` (B12).** The CMS link field stores `appearance` as `default` or
`outline` (`src/platform/payload/link.ts:10`, `:14`). `default` maps to `Button · primary` and `outline` to
`Button · secondary`. The high-impact hero and the CTA block ignore the field today and style their
buttons by position (H2, H3, B14, B15).

**`SegmentedControl`** (#1118) joins two or three short options into one small 36 px control with one border and divider lines, named by a label or a visible one; the picked option is filled with the accent and says so with `aria-pressed`, and each option is a `Button`. It draws what it is given and keeps no state. Its test covers the group, the joined look, the callback and axe; the gallery shows two and three options. `Field` places it beside its box with `aside` (a short label on the line of the field's label, the control on the box's row), and `Card` has an `xs` padding for the compact cards of the whole-bill tab.

## Form fields

Components: [form fields](../reference/components/form-fields.md).

**`Field` controls.** A field holds exactly one control, a part of `Field` like `CardBody` is a part
of `Card`: `Field.Input`, `Field.Money` (a whole-dollar box that groups digits with commas as the reader types and keeps a number's size when its first digit is replaced, #1035, #1172), `Field.TextArea`, `Field.Select` and `Field.Checkbox` (the field switches to
`layout: inline`; `layout: bar` puts the label above, then the control and an `action` button (a compact Estimate or Search button) on one line, the control taking the room the button leaves, with the hint and error under both, #1087; `actionPlacement: inside` puts the action inside the box at its trailing end, with one border and one focus ring around both, an equal 6 px inset above, below and at the end, and the border taking the accent while the action is not disabled, #1110). The frame passes the control its `id`, `aria-describedby` and `aria-invalid`, so
no control repeats that wiring. Each control works with a controlled value or react-hook-form's
`register`. In the coverage table, `Field · email` means a field holding `Field.Input type="email"`.

## Display

Components: [cards](../reference/components/cards.md), [display](../reference/components/display.md), [sections and page headers](../reference/components/sections.md) and [media](../reference/components/media.md).

**`Badge`** (#952) has two sizes (`size`: `sm`, the default, and `md`, slightly bigger words and icon), set with the variant. A mark that must stand out among small labels, such as a state mark on the plan, uses `md`; labels stay `default`. Its test covers both sizes and the plan's state mark; the gallery shows `md`.

**`Tabs`** (#661, #1112) is one row of plain, equal buttons above its panel: the same width (the row is shared out equally, two to four tabs) and height (at least 48 px), the label centred on one line, with a small gap between them, never joined to the panel, which keeps its own border. A quiet tab has a thin border and a muted label; the selected one has the primary border, a soft primary fill and a bolder label (with `aria-selected`), all from theme tokens, and every tab carries the same class string. A button holds a short label and, when screen readers need more, visually hidden text after it; the editor's label limit, not CSS, keeps a label short enough to fit. Its tests (`Tabs.look.test.tsx`, `Tabs.client.test.tsx`) cover the look, the links, the arrow keys and axe; the gallery shows two, three and four tabs.

**`BarTrack`** (#1196) is one bar on a muted, rounded track, as wide as its share (a percent), with its height set by the caller and a `data-*` mark to find it by; it can animate its fill (`reveal`) or outline it (`edge`). `ShareBill`'s rows and the breakdown chart's rows both draw their bars with it, so there is one copy of the markup. Its test covers the width, the mark and axe; the gallery shows it.

**`ShareBill`** (#1111, #1118, #1196) draws one whole as a bill like a receipt: its title on top with no amount, then one row for every slice, in the order given: the name, the percent and the dollars flush right (the percents in one column, the dollars in their own column that grows to the widest amount, a clear gap between the two, the total's amount under the rows' amounts, #1163, #1184), and under them the slice's own bar in its tone, drawn like the City breakdown's rows. The bars share one scale, the largest slice's, so every bar's length is in proportion to the others; every row is built the same way (no colour square, no fill, no rule of its own), so the rows and bars sit level and no slice is told by its colour alone. The total is the last line (bold, under a stronger rule), so a block holding it never changes height when the amounts do. The total flashes the accent once each time `pulseKey` changes, unless motion is reduced. A `nested` row can sit directly under one slice's row for an open-and-close row about that slice: set in from the left with a line in the City's colour down its side, and its amounts set in from the right (`NESTED_AMOUNTS_INSET`), so they end before the bodies' amounts and are not read as parts of the sum (#1163, #1196). Its test covers the order, the rows, the bars' scale, the nested row, the flash and axe; the gallery shows it wide and narrow. It replaces the pie and the segmented bar the whole-bill tab used to draw (both removed).

**`ProgressBar`** (#939) shows how far along something is, as a native `<progress>` that screen readers read as a named bar (`label`), in two sizes (`sm`, `md`). The fill's width comes from the element's own value, not an inline style, and a `max` of 0 shows an empty bar. The caller always writes the numbers next to it ("3 of 8 done"), so the bar is never the only signal. Its test covers the clamping and axe; the gallery shows it.

**`AreaChart`** (#1190) draws how much happened over time as a smooth curve with a soft fill, a faint baseline, three day labels (the last one "Today") and a marker on the latest value, in the done or open tone. Several read side by side share one `max`; a running total starts at its lowest value (`fromZero={false}`) so its shape shows; all zeros is the flat baseline. It has a text `label` listing every value, and the caller always writes the figure beside it. Its test covers the shared scale, the clamp, one and no values, theme tokens only and axe; the gallery shows a count per day, a running total and the open count.

**`HeatMap`** (#1191) shows how much happened each day as squares, darker for more, in two shapes: `week` is a strip that stretches to the width of its box with a weekday letter over each square, and `calendar` is Monday-to-Sunday rows that fill the width of their box (squares wider than tall, 44 px tall on phones, 40 px from 640 px), each row named by its Monday, with the days still to come dashed. The last day is ringed (`today` names another day, or `null` for none, as in a past month), and a finished period leaves the days after its last one empty with `toCome={false}`. Shades step with each day's share of the darkest value (`max`, shared by maps read side by side); a zero is a faint square, never a hole. A text `label` lists every value for screen readers, and the caller writes the figure beside it. Theme tokens only. With a `selection` (#1204) the days are `Button`s (`HeatCell`) with `aria-pressed`, the map is a named group, the pressed days wear the ring (today's ring is left off), and a day outside `enabled` is a muted, slashed, disabled square named with its reason (such as "not selected above"); the caller holds the chosen days and decides what a press does. Pressable calendar squares are 44 px tall on phones (40 px from 640 px) and as wide as their column; the week strips are 44 px tall on phones (36 px from 1024 px); seven columns and their dates cannot be 44 px wide at 320 px, so the tap area reaches 2 px past each side (above the 24 px minimum of WCAG 2.5.8). An optional `caption` (#1205) sits under the squares with a Less-to-More key made from the same shades as the squares (so the two cannot disagree): on one line at every width (the caption left, the key right), and the swatches are hidden from screen readers because `label` lists every value. Its test covers both shapes, the shading, the caption and key, the ring, the dashed days, the selectable mode and axe; the gallery shows it.

**`MapEmbed`** (#764, #884) is a small map picture over its text, filling the width it is given: the page's Section decides how wide it is and where it sits. It opens
a live Google map in a `Dialog`
when a neighbor taps the picture or the "View the larger map" button. The frame is created only
after that tap, so the page asks Google for nothing before it, and then Google receives the visit
(the page's origin only, `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`). Only Google's keyless embed addresses
("Embed a map" and My Maps) are accepted (`toGoogleMapsEmbedUrl`); with none, the picture and text
show and there is no button. Its test checks the closed and the open dialog with axe (the frame
removed, since jsdom can't run axe across one), the gallery shows both states, and its props are in
the [media page](../reference/components/media.md).

**`FeaturedImage`** (#1013, #1023) is the picture of a post or an event, under the metadata bar: the whole picture at its own proportions, never cropped, loading early (it is the first image seen), with its credit under it. It is the shared `Figure` (size `half-then-third`, `zoom={false}`): full width above the text on a phone, floated right from `md` at half the column, and a third from `lg`, with the text wrapping beside it; it has no Enlarge button and opens no dialog (#1055). With no picture it draws nothing and leaves no gap. `ArticlePage` draws it in one box with the content, which contains the float so what follows a short article clears the picture; the article's `RichText` takes `besideFloat`; `ArticlePage`'s `lead` is what opens the article ahead of the picture (a row of cards, which can't sit beside it). The page header above is the `PageHeader` `band` (a themed surface, optionally over a faded photo, `BandBackdrop`; never the page's own picture). Its test checks the three sizes, the float, the early load, the missing Enlarge button, the empty case and axe; the gallery shows it beside text.

**`BandBackdrop`** (#1024) is the faded photo behind the title band of a post or an event
(`PageHeader` `variant="band"`, `backdrop`). It is edge to edge inside the band, grayed
(`grayscale-50`), faded (`opacity-60`) and washed with a `--surface` scrim (`bg-surface/50`), so the
photo reaches the title at 30% of its strength; those two numbers are `BAND_PHOTO_ALPHA` and
`BAND_SCRIM_ALPHA` in the theme contract, and `themes.test.ts` checks the title's colour on the band
over a black and over a white photo, in light and dark, so contrast holds whatever the photo. A
band's category badges sit on a solid plate (`BadgeList plated`), since a badge's tint is
see-through. The backdrop is one crop per screen size (phone under `md`, tablet from `md`, desktop
from `lg`), each an upload with its own focal point; a photo several sizes use is drawn once, and
an image not shown at the screen's size is not loaded. It adds no height: it fills the band. Nothing
set is the plain band, with identical markup. It is a decoration (hidden from assistive tech, empty
alt) and loads lightly (`IMAGE_QUALITIES.backdrop`, `sizes="100vw"`, no early load). Its test checks
all of this and axe; the gallery shows it in the headers entry.

**`MetaBar`** (#1002, #1055) is the metadata of a post or an event, the industry's byline or meta bar: one thin
line of small text at the top of the article's column, above the text, with a hairline between the items. The labels are
small, uppercase and muted, in the theme's finest text size (`text-fine`, the `type-fine` token). A post shows
its author and its published date, nothing else; an event shows when (date and time) and where (the venue
or address, with its format). Directly under the text, across the whole column, runs one straight
groove line: two hairlines, a dark one (`input`) and the theme's accent. There is no box, tab or pill,
and the line is the same at every width. It is one decorative element, hidden from assistive
technology, with no measuring and no inline SVG; the metadata is a description list of real text.
`align` sets where the text sits. `start` (the default, an event's) groups the items at the left with values in
`text-xs`: from `md` one row aligned on their text baseline, below `md` a two-column list, labels in one
column and values in the other, both starting at the left edge; a place too long for one line is cut with an
ellipsis, capped at 20rem, and it gives up width first, so the date and time stay on one line. `end` (a post's)
puts the labels and values in `text-fine` and keeps one row at every width, ending on the column's right edge: the
author, a value too long for the row, is cut with an ellipsis and never wraps, and the date, written compactly
("Nov 3"), keeps its width. In both, a cut value has its whole text in its `title` (as `Breadcrumbs` does) and in
the page. `ArticlePage` draws it from its `byline` items, with `bylineAlign` for the alignment, at the width of what sits
under it (a post: the text; an event: the whole column), with clear space (2.5rem) under it. Its test checks the labels, the hidden line, the missing
box, the baseline and stacking classes, both alignments, the cut value, the label token and axe; the gallery shows two
items and a long value at the start, and a post's bar with a short and a long name at the end.

**`Figure`** (#816) is a small picture that floats right in an article, about two fifths of the text
column by default (`size`: `third`, `two-fifths`, `half`, or `half-then-third` for `FeaturedImage`),
with the text wrapping on its left from `md` up; `zoom={false}` draws only the picture and its caption, with no expand icon or dialog (`FeaturedImage` does, so the picture starts on the text's first line); below `md` it fills the column between paragraphs. Its label ("Figure 2-9") sits in a
neutral badge with the short caption. A click or tap on the picture, or on the small expand icon over its top-right corner (#1156: icon only, 44 px, on a dark translucent backing, always visible, named "Enlarge: <title>"), opens the `Zoom` dialog with the large picture,
and beside it (under it on a narrow screen) the long caption and the numbered key: the key never
shows in the small view. Its test covers the float classes, the size, the icon-only control, the dialog and axe; the gallery
shows it. `FigureBlock` (#817) is the editor's block: it maps the stored fields to `Figure`'s props
and is shown by the same gallery entry; its test checks the render and axe.

## Feedback and overlays

Components: [feedback and overlays](../reference/components/feedback.md).

**`RouteDialog`** (#946) is a `Dialog` that is a page of its own: it opens over the page that led to it,
and its close button, its back button and Escape all go back one step in the browser's history. It uses the
`center` placement of `Dialog`, a panel over a dimmed page, where the default `sheet` fills the screen.
Next.js intercepts the route for a click inside the site, and a direct visit or refresh shows the full page,
so the address always works. Its test covers the three ways out and axe.

**`Zoom`** (#815) is a small view that opens larger in a full-screen `Dialog`: the Enlarge button, or a
click or tap on the small view, opens it, with focus kept in the dialog and returned to the button on
close. The optional `aside` (a legend, a long caption) shows beside the large view from `lg` and under
it below, and never in the small view; without a `large` view the small view itself moves into the
dialog, drawn once. `trigger="icon"` swaps the text button for an icon-only control over the small view's top-right corner (`Figure`'s, #1156); a chart keeps the text button. With scripting off the control is hidden. `ChartZoom` is a thin caller of it, and
`Figure` (#816) is another. Its test covers both layouts, the keyboard, focus return and axe, and the
gallery shows it.

`Alert` has four tones: `info` is blue (`info` and `info-strong` theme tokens, #818), `success` green, `warning` amber and `error` red. Each is a 10% tint with its `-strong` text, checked at 4.5:1 in light and dark, and each has its own icon, so colour is never the only cue.

## Navigation

Components: [navigation and page tools](../reference/components/navigation.md).

**`PeriodNav`** (#1218) is a title between two icon buttons that step to the period before and the one after it, such as the month a calendar shows. It holds no state: the caller gives the title, what each button is called for screen readers (`previousLabel`, `nextLabel`), what a press does, and which direction cannot go on (`previousDisabled`, `nextDisabled`). The title is announced politely when it changes. Its test covers the labels, the handlers, the disabled states, the announcement and axe; the gallery shows it.

## Layout

Components: [layout and page structure](../reference/components/layout.md).

**`PageBackdrop`** (#777) draws an editor's photo faded and grayed behind a page, under its text. The
photo fills the top 28 rem of the page and is washed into the theme's background at both ends, so
it is felt rather than seen and leaves no edge; it is never placed between a title and its content.
It is a decoration: hidden from assistive tech, empty alt, no motion, and the field takes pictures
only (`imagesOnly`). It loads at once (`priority`), at the lighter `IMAGE_QUALITIES.backdrop`. Inside
it, for **all of the page's content** and not only the photo's area, muted text becomes a mix of the
main text colour and the background, and primary-coloured text takes `primary-strong`, so text keeps
AA contrast over the photo in light and dark. With no photo it draws only its children, so a page
without one is unchanged. Its test checks these with axe.

## Rich text (`src/platform/richtext/`)

Components: [rich text](../reference/components/rich-text.md) (`src/platform/richtext/`).

## How many, and what to build first

- **The shared components** are counted and listed in the [generated reference](../reference/components/README.md). The owner's review
  on 2026-10-21 cut nine of the first proposal's 32. Seven were merged: the four input components
  became parts of `Field`, `Heading` became variants of `Text`, `DetailHero` became
  `PageHeader · image`, and `Container` became `Section`'s `width`. Two moved into the one area
  that uses them (next point).
- **Kept in the one place that uses them,** under the rule "add a component when a second screen
  needs it" (#163): the loading placeholder is a style inside `SiteHeader`. The FAQ accordion moved to the
  shared `Disclosure` once `OnThisPage` needed the same `<details>` row (#610), which also has a bare `link` look for "See the smaller pieces" in a breakdown chart (#866) and a compact `row` look with no box of its own, for the closed rows under a whole-bill tab, which sit in one `Card` split by `divide-y` lines (#1111, #1118), and a `listRow` look for a row inside a list, such as the breakdown row inside the whole bill's receipt (it expands and folds over 500 ms, `disclosure-expand`, #1170), and an `onOpening` callback called from the summary's click while the box is still closed (#1163, #1165). Its chevron turns only for its own box (a selector on the box's own summary, never `group-open:`, which fires for any open box around it, #967), so boxes nest, as on the Plan page. A box a reader opens is scrolled into view by the component itself, the same on every page: its end shows, or its summary row when it is taller than the screen; no page or module adds scrolling of its own (#1152); a box can name an anchor, an element such as its card's heading that stays under the sticky header when it opens, and a box that opens by itself scrolls the same way (#1178). Boxes meant to be read as one group are placed as siblings, one directly under the other, so an opened one also shows the next one's summary row (#1154).
- **Build order:** `Button` and `Link` (19 and 12 elements), then `Field` and `Form`, then `Card`,
  `Media`, `PageHeader` and `EmptyState`.

## Decided choices

Two parts of the set differed from rules already written down. Both are settled (#426):

1. **Card looks.** The owner kept today's looks (2026-10-26, Claude Code session): the `elevated`,
   `outline`, `muted`, `tinted` and `accent` variants and the compact `padding: sm` (`p-4`). The card rules
   in [`ui-ux-design.md`](../guidelines/ui-ux-design.md#card-design) now say so.
2. **Plain props for blocks and heroes.** Decided from established practice, as the owner asked:
   [decision 0013](../architecture/decisions/0013-cms-content-through-mappers.md). Blocks and
   heroes take plain typed props, built by a `to…Props` mapper in the module's `data/`, and
   [rule 8](../architecture/README.md#dependency-rules) says so.
