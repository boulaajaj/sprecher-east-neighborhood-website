# Project facts

What the Sprecher East website runs on and how to work with it locally: stack, hosting,
environment variables, and known gotchas. It describes the system; the rules for changing it
are in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), and where code goes is in [`architecture/`](architecture/README.md).
Keep it current: a change that makes a line here wrong updates it in the same PR.

## Project Overview

Grassroots neighborhood website for Sprecher East (Madison, WI), live at https://sprechereast.com.
It is an unofficial, AI-assisted initiative (ground rules in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#ground-rules)).

**Repos:**

- Website (this repo, PUBLIC): `boulaajaj/sprecher-east-neighborhood-website`
- Strategy docs (PRIVATE): `boulaajaj/sprecher-east-strategy`

## Current Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript; Turbopack builds), React 19.2
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS v4 (design tokens in `src/app/(frontend)/globals.css @theme {}`)
- **CMS**: Payload CMS v3 Website Template at `/admin` (self-hosted, SQLite `data/payload.db`)
- **Auth**: Payload native auth (Users collection with `auth: true`); roles `admin`, `editor`, `resident`. Pages and server actions ask `src/modules/accounts/` who is signed in (`getCurrentUser`, `requireUser`, `requireRole`); sign-in (Payload's `login` helper from `@payloadcms/next/auth`), sign-out, password changes and forgot/reset password (Payload's `forgotPassword` and `resetPassword`, with a branded email linking to `/reset-password`, #269) are its server actions. Forgot password runs only from the site's page, behind the robot check and per-connection and site-wide limits, and Payload sends the email after the answer, so the time doesn't show whether an account exists (#282); Payload's REST and GraphQL forgot password answer 403, and `/admin/forgot` redirects to `/forgot-password`. Residents sign up on `/sign-up` (linked from the header, the mobile menu and `/login` (#296), and offered on `/confirm-email` after a contact sender confirms) through Payload's `create` with `auth.verify`: the branded verification email links to `/verify-account`, and an unverified account can't sign in or get a reset email (#187). Verifying takes the Confirm button and the robot check on that page; Payload's REST verify answers 403, its GraphQL verify mutation is refused, and `/admin/users/verify/<token>` redirects to `/verify-account` (#303). Signing up again with an unverified account's email sends a new link, at most 3 times per 3 hours, counted on the account; a resent link asks the person to choose the password on `/verify-account` before the account opens, so a password from an earlier sign-up never activates (#289)
- **Email**: `@payloadcms/email-nodemailer` over SMTP (Mailgun in production); logs to the console when `SMTP_HOST` is unset. Email addresses typed into public forms are confirmed by link (`src/modules/verification/`, #183): the link opens a page whose Confirm button also passes the robot check, so mail scanners that open the link confirm nothing (#303); a contact message's emails go out only once its sender confirms (#287)
- **Spam protection**: Cloudflare Turnstile on public forms and on the Confirm buttons of `/confirm-email` and `/verify-account`, plus size and rate limits (decision records in `docs/architecture/decisions/`)
- **Tests**: Vitest unit tests next to the code (`*.test.ts`), run with `npm test` and in CI (#139). Component tests (`*.test.tsx`) run in jsdom with Testing Library and axe (`expectAccessible` in `src/platform/ui/testing/`)
- **Rich Text**: Lexical editor with slash menu, toolbars, inline images, and custom blocks
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Payload docs for agents**: https://payloadcms.com/llms-full.txt (the whole Payload documentation in one file)
- **Hosting**: Hostinger VPS (Ubuntu 24.04, PM2 + Caddy)

## VPS / Hosting

- **VM ID**: 1371281
- **Hostname**: srv1371281.hstgr.cloud
- **IP**: 187.77.27.93
- **Domain**: sprechereast.com (live since 2026-10-17, see #103)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04 with Docker
- **Plan**: KVM 1 (1 CPU, 4 GB RAM, 50 GB disk)
- **Deploy path**: /var/www/sprecher-east: the shared `.env.local`, `data/` and `public/media`,
  one folder per build in `releases/`, and `current`, the link to the live one (#245)
- **Process manager**: PM2 (process `sprecher-east`, config `ecosystem.config.cjs`); Next listens on
  `127.0.0.1:3000` only (#118), so visitors reach it through Caddy
- **Web server**: Caddy (HTTPS on 443 and HTTP on 80, reverse proxy → `127.0.0.1:3000`); request
  body limit on the form endpoints (#124)
- **Backups**: daily, weekly and pre-deploy archives of the database, media and `.env.local` in
  `/var/backups/sprecher-east` (#148); restore steps in [`ops/README.md`](../ops/README.md)
- **Hostinger API**: Use `$HOSTINGER_API_KEY` env var for snapshots and management
  - API base: `https://developers.hostinger.com`
  - Snapshot endpoint: `POST /api/vps/v1/virtual-machines/1371281/snapshot`
- **SSH**: User `root`, port 22, key at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sprecher`
- **CI/CD**: every merge to `main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` from CI, once the required
  checks pass: GitHub Actions builds the release with the server's Node version, uploads it to
  `releases/<commit>`, and the VPS backs up, migrates, switches `current`, reloads PM2 and checks
  the site, switching back if it doesn't answer (#245). Rollback by hand: `ops/rollback.sh`.
  The server scripts are in [`ops/`](../ops/README.md)
- **Caddy config**: `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`. Rules for editing it (never overwrite, back up,
  validate) are in [`guidelines/security.md`](guidelines/security.md#infrastructure-security)
- **Live domains**: `sprechereast.com` (HTTPS), `www.sprechereast.com` (redirects to it). The
  domain sends HSTS (`max-age` in `ops/caddy/hsts.caddy`, rolled out in stages; no
  `includeSubDomains` or `preload`), and plain HTTP to the IP on port 80 redirects to
  `https://sprechereast.com` with a 308 (`ops/caddy-https.sh`, #235)

## Architecture

**Read [`docs/architecture/`](architecture/README.md) before writing code.** It has the
target structure (one module per business area under `src/modules/`, shared code in
`src/platform/`, routes and composition only in `src/app/`), the dependency rules, where each kind
of code goes, naming [conventions](architecture/conventions.md), the [glossary](architecture/glossary.md),
the [data model](architecture/data-model.md) and [decision records](architecture/decisions/README.md).

Every business area has moved to that structure (#127), and lint fails on an import that breaks
its rules (#137). The Payload website template's folders are gone; the few exceptions (seed,
generated files) are listed in [`architecture/`](architecture/README.md#exceptions).

## Known Gotchas

- **npm installs**: Always use `--legacy-peer-deps` for Payload packages
- **Payload REST route**: `REST_GET(config)` — curried, NOT `REST_GET(req, config)`
- **Payload importMap**: Auto-generated on dev server start at `src/app/(payload)/admin/importMap.js`
- **`defaultSort`**: Must be on collection root, NOT inside `admin: {}`
- **`npx payload run` broken on Node v24**: Use direct node scripts instead
- **`graphql` package**: Must install separately from `@payloadcms/graphql`
- **`overrideAccess`**: Set it on every Local API call: `false` for what a visitor may see, `true` only where access must be bypassed, with a comment saying why. The seed's writes don't set it yet, and the header and footer are read with `overrideAccess: true` (#251)
- **`server-only`**: Server code outside the CMS config that queries Payload or reads cookies (utilities, `data/`, `use-cases/`, `server.ts`) starts with `import 'server-only'`, so a client component importing it fails the build. Collections, hooks and plugins never import it: the Payload CLI (`migrate`, seed) loads them outside Next.js, where it throws. Hooks use the `req.payload` they are given
- **Cache tags**: Expire them with `expireCacheTag()` from `src/platform/payload/expireCacheTag.ts`. Since Next 16, `revalidateTag` needs a second argument; the helper passes `{ expire: 0 }`, so the next visitor gets fresh content
- **`next build` skips the type check**: `next.config.js` sets `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors`, because CI's required Type-check step already checks types and the step timed out the deploy on the server (#246). CI runs `npx next typegen` before `npx tsc --noEmit`, so the route types in `.next/types` (page, layout and route handler exports) are checked too (#248). Run both locally; a green build alone doesn't mean the types are right
- **The release is built without content**: the deploy builds in CI against an empty database, so the server drops the prerendered pages before the switch and each page renders from the live database on its first visit (#245). `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values come from the server's `.env.local` at build time; after changing one there, redeploy (Actions → Deploy to VPS → Run workflow)
- **Proxy**: `src/proxy.ts` (Next 16's name for middleware) answers 404 for junk paging URLs before they render (#119)
- **Upload URLs stay relative**: `getMediaUrl()` turns Payload's upload URLs (prefixed with `serverURL`) back into `/api/media/file/...`, so next/image treats them as local; since Next 16 it refuses remote URLs on private IPs such as localhost
- **Sign-in cookie is Secure in production**: the Users collection sets `auth.cookies.secure` when `NODE_ENV` is `production` (#234), so signing in (site and `/admin`) works over HTTPS only. Over plain http the browser drops the cookie; the IP on port 80 redirects to HTTPS (#235). `next dev` on `http://localhost` is unaffected
- **Live Preview**: Uses `window.postMessage` — component must use `useLivePreview()` hook
- **Draft Preview**: Requires `PREVIEW_SECRET` env var for signed preview URLs
- **Timezone**: Configured via `SITE_TIMEZONE` env var (default: `America/Chicago`). Use `startOfToday()` and `SITE_TIMEZONE` from `src/platform/lib/timezone.ts`. Never hardcode timezone strings or use bare `new Date().setHours(0,0,0,0)`. Day-only dates (midnight UTC) must be formatted with `timeZone: 'UTC'` to avoid off-by-one; `formatDateTime()` handles this automatically.

## Connected Tools

- **Asana** (REST API): `$ASANA_PAT` user env var. GIDs stored in `$ASANA_WORKSPACE_GID` and `$ASANA_PROJECT_GID` env vars. Use `curl` with Bearer auth. On Windows, pass JSON via temp file (`-d @/tmp/file.json`).
- **Slack** (MCP): sprechereast.slack.com, channel #sprecher-east-na (ID: C0AJ124LBB2)
- **Analytics**: PostHog (planned — cookieless mode, free cloud tier)
