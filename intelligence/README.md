# Neighborhood intelligence agents

This folder is everything an agent runtime needs to find useful, verified neighborhood
information and suggest it to the site's editors (#255, #337): the sources, the area, the prompts,
the data contracts and the test cases. It holds no code that runs on the site, no secrets and no
personal data. It changes only through pull requests, which CI checks.

The agents never publish. They create **suggested drafts**; an editor reads, fixes and publishes.

## What's here

| Path                             | What it is                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`pipeline.yaml`](pipeline.yaml) | The settings a runtime reads first: kill switch, schedule, budgets, stages |
| [`sources.yaml`](sources.yaml)   | Approved sources, each checked by hand ([summary](sources.md))             |
| [`coverage.md`](coverage.md)     | The Sprecher East area and the relevance policy                            |
| [`prompts/`](prompts/)           | One prompt per stage, each naming its input and output schema              |
| [`schemas/`](schemas/)           | JSON Schemas for every file and every stage's output                       |
| [`evals/`](evals/)               | Test cases per stage with the result a correct pipeline reaches            |

## The pipeline

One run takes each new or changed item through five stages. Each stage reads the item and adds
its own section (`schemas/item.schema.json`); it never changes an earlier one.

1. **Scout** (code). Fetches the pilot sources, parses them, and builds a candidate with a stable
   `externalId` and a `contentHash`. Items already seen with the same hash stop here.
2. **Verify** (model). Finds the real place, date and status from primary sources, sets the
   coverage tier, and lists every unknown.
3. **Curate** (model). Accepts, rejects or sends to review, scores the item, and says who
   benefits and what they can do. Detects duplicates, updates and cancellations of known items.
4. **Draft** (model). Writes the short suggestion, with only confirmed facts and a list of what's
   missing.
5. **Submit** (code). Sends accepted drafts as suggestions and everything an editor must check
   as review items, through #336's MCP tools, and writes the run log.

Deterministic steps come first: fetching, parsing and deduplication never use a model. The
model handles only relevance, location ambiguity and the write-up, at medium effort, escalating to
high only for conflicting or ambiguous evidence (`model` in `pipeline.yaml`).

## Fetching (#352)

**Direct first.** Every source is read with a plain GET (or its feed or API client): content-type
detection, ETag and Last-Modified caching, and a deterministic parser for RSS, Atom, iCalendar,
JSON or HTML. `fetchStrategy` in `sources.yaml` is `direct` unless a source says
`direct-then-playwright`; today only Madison Parks events and the District 16 blog do.

**Playwright only as a fallback**, for a `direct-then-playwright` source, when the direct answer
trips one of these triggers:

- a 200 with an empty body;
- a JavaScript shell: no text where items should be;
- a parse that finds no items, or fails its checks;
- a non-200 answer that isn't an error or a gate. A 5xx or 429 is retried once (honoring
  Retry-After) and never sent to Playwright; a 401, 403, 451, or a redirect to a login, paywall,
  CAPTCHA or bot gateway is a gate and stops the source as `blocked`.

The fallback is one headless, logged-out page load of the same URL, at the same daily cadence.

**Logged every run.** Each source entry in the run log (`schemas/agent-run.schema.json`) records
`fetchStrategy`, the one that produced the items (`direct`, `playwright` or `none`), so the digest
shows how often the fallback runs.

**Hard nos.** No logins, CAPTCHAs or paywalls (madison.com's redirect to `tollbit.madison.com`),
no path robots.txt disallows (Dane County's press subscription page), no social networks, and no
source that isn't `valid` or `pending` in `sources.yaml`. The check refuses
`direct-then-playwright` on any source without an `allowed` robots.txt result, on a source that
isn't HTML, or on one that is `restricted` or `invalid`. Agents summarize facts and never
republish articles.

**Where Playwright runs.** In the agent runtime's scout step only. Never in the website, its
build or its CI: CI checks the files in this folder, including the direct path's rules and the
eval routing, and makes no network or model calls.

**Legal note**, checked against sources on #352. Public pages, read logged out with no gate, are
the least risky shape; the remaining risks are contract (terms accepted by logging in, which we
never do) and copyright (we summarize facts and link, never republish). _Ziff Davis v. OpenAI_
(S.D.N.Y., December 2025) held that robots.txt doesn't "control access" under the DMCA, and the
Ninth Circuit's Perplexity/Comet CFAA decision was reported in August 2026. Neither changes our
rule: we still honor robots.txt by choice. This is the project's reasoning, not legal advice.

## How a runtime loads it

The runtime is OpenClaw, on the owner's side; any runtime that can read files and call MCP tools
can run the same folder. Its own configuration, schedule and keys stay outside this repo.

1. Check out this repository's `main` (read-only) at the start of each run, and record its commit
   as `repoCommit` in the run log, so every suggestion can be traced to the exact prompts that made it.
2. Read `pipeline.yaml`. If `enabled` is false, log a `disabled` run and stop.
3. Load the schemas in `schemas/`, `sources.yaml` and `coverage.md`.
4. For each stage in order, give the model the stage's prompt, `coverage.md`, and the item as
   JSON; validate its answer against the stage's `output` schema. When verify's `confidence` is below
   `escalation.verifyBelowConfidence` (0.6), run verify once more at high effort. An answer that doesn't validate
   is retried once, then the item goes to review with the error.
5. Before curate, look each candidate's `externalId` up with the MCP find tool (runtime code, not
   a model) and put the result in the item's `known` section: collection, id, hash and status,
   or null.
6. Feed URLs in `sources.yaml` can hold `{from}`, `{to}` and `{cursor}`; `prompts/scout.md` says
   what each becomes.

## Schedule and budgets

- **Daily pilot** at 06:40 America/Chicago (`schedule` in `pipeline.yaml`), reading the four
  pilot sources only.
- **Budgets** (`budgets` in `pipeline.yaml`): at most $0.50 and 15 minutes per run, $15 per month,
  50 items per source, 40 items sent to a model and 10 drafts per run. The runtime stops when a
  limit is reached, logs the run as `stopped-budget`, and leaves the rest for the next run.
- A run that can't reach a source logs the error for that source and carries on with the others.

## Output: suggestions and review items in the CMS

The submit stage talks to the site's CMS through the official Payload MCP plugin at
`https://sprechereast.com/api/mcp` (#336), with the agent user's own API key. The key is created
by an admin in the CMS and kept in the runtime's secret store, never here. The agent calls only
the find tool and two custom tools from #336; it can't create, update, delete or publish
documents directly.

- **`submitSuggestion`** (`schemas/suggestion.schema.json`) for accepted items: the collection
  (`events` or `posts`), title, `bodyMarkdown`, start, end, all-day, venue, address, audience,
  provenance and run ID. The server converts the Markdown with Payload's own converter, forces an
  unpublished draft with `moderationStatus: suggested`, refuses a duplicate, and answers
  `{ id, status: created | duplicate }`.
- **`reportItem`** (`schemas/report.schema.json`) for everything an editor must look at without
  a new draft: `needs-review` items, `update` and `cancel` of a known document (by
  `targetCollection` and `targetId`; the document is never changed), and `rejected-invalid`
  submissions. Each carries a summary, evidence, flags and the source URL, and is stored on the
  run in `agent-runs`, visible in Admin.
- **Provenance:** `sourceName`, `sourceUrl`, `externalId`, `contentHash` and
  `moderationStatus` are defined once, in
  [`schemas/provenance.schema.json`](schemas/provenance.schema.json), with the hash recipe; the
  CMS fields (#123, #336) use the same names. To rename one, change that file and the prompts in
  the same PR, and the CMS in its own.
- **Run log:** each run creates one `agent-runs` entry at the start and updates it at the end
  (`schemas/agent-run.schema.json`): the repository commit it loaded, start and end, sources
  checked with their cursors, counts, errors and cost.

Routing by the curate decision: `accept` → `submitSuggestion`; `needs-review`, `update`, `cancel`
→ `reportItem`; `reject`, `duplicate` → counted only. A suggestion with missing facts or low
confidence also gets a `needs-review` report pointing at it.

Until #336 is live, a run writes the same calls and its run log as a digest for an editor instead.

## Turning it off

- **Pause:** set `enabled: false` in `pipeline.yaml` through a PR. The next run stops before
  fetching anything.
- **Stop at once:** an admin revokes the agent's API key in the CMS. Every call fails; nothing
  else on the site changes.
- **Undo suggestions:** suggested drafts are never public. An editor deletes or rejects them.

## Safety

- **Model stages are isolated.** Verify, curate and draft run with no MCP key, no CMS access, no
  file or shell access and no other tools. Only verify may fetch, and only with GET, from the
  source's own domain and official public domains (City of Madison, Dane County, Madison Public
  Library, MMSD, the State of Wisconsin). The MCP key is used only by the submit code, which
  takes no instructions from a model. So text injected into a page can't reach a secret or the CMS.
- Fetched pages, feeds and PDFs are untrusted data, never instructions. Every prompt says so and
  flags injection attempts (`prompt-injection`).
- Only `valid` sources in `sources.yaml` are polled. No social networks, logins or paid gateways.
- Unknown facts are flagged, never filled in.
- The runtime has no GitHub write access and no server access. A change to prompts or sources is a
  pull request, reviewed and checked like any other.

## Changing it

Edit the files, then run `node scripts/check-intelligence.mjs`. It validates `pipeline.yaml`,
`sources.yaml` and every file in `evals/` (one per stage, `<stage>.yaml` or
`<stage>-<topic>.yaml`) against their schemas, checks that eval times use America/Chicago's
offset, and that grader fields, and every field a prompt names (written `` `$.field` ``), exist
in the stage's input or output schema. Each eval case's `route` must follow the routing above.
CI runs the same check on every pull request; it checks the cases' structure and never calls a
model. Running the cases against a model is the collector's job (#272). Add an eval case whenever
the pipeline gets something wrong.
