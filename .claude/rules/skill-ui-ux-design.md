# World-Class UI/UX Design Standards

Design principles for creating a pixel-perfect, modern, intuitive neighborhood website. Every agent building UI must follow these standards — they are not aspirational, they are requirements.

## Design Philosophy

This website represents a real community. Residents will judge it in 3 seconds. If it looks amateur, they leave. If it looks polished, they trust it. Design quality is not a nice-to-have — it's the difference between a community platform people use and one they ignore.

**The standard**: Every page must look like it was designed by a top-tier product design team. Clean, modern, warm, and intentional. No element should look accidental or unfinished.

## Visual Hierarchy

Every page must have a clear visual hierarchy that guides the eye:

1. **Primary element** (hero heading, page title) — largest, boldest, most prominent
2. **Supporting content** (subheadings, key info) — clearly secondary but still prominent
3. **Body content** (paragraphs, lists) — comfortable reading size
4. **Tertiary elements** (metadata, captions, labels) — smaller, muted, but still legible

**Rules:**

- Headings must have enough size contrast with body text (at least 1.5x for h2, 2x for h1)
- Never use more than 3 font sizes on a single screen view
- Use font weight (not just size) to create hierarchy — `font-bold` for headings, `font-normal` for body, `font-light` sparingly
- Eyebrow text (category labels, section identifiers) uses `text-xs font-bold tracking-widest uppercase text-primary`

## Spacing System

Consistent spacing creates visual rhythm. Use Tailwind's spacing scale exclusively:

- **Section spacing**: `py-16 md:py-20 lg:py-24` between major page sections
- **Content gaps**: `gap-6 md:gap-8` for grid/flex layouts
- **Element spacing**: `space-y-4` or `space-y-6` for stacked elements within a section
- **Container padding**: `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8` for horizontal page padding
- **Card padding**: `p-6 md:p-8` for card interiors

**Rules:**

- Never use arbitrary spacing values — stick to the Tailwind scale (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24)
- Spacing between sections should be generous — white space is not wasted space, it's breathing room
- Related elements have tighter spacing; unrelated elements have more separation
- The gap between a heading and its content should be smaller than the gap between two sections

## Color and Contrast

**WCAG AA minimum contrast ratios are mandatory:**

- Normal text (< 18px): **4.5:1** contrast ratio against background
- Large text (>= 18px bold or >= 24px): **3:1** contrast ratio
- UI components and icons: **3:1** against adjacent colors

**Rules:**

- `text-foreground` on `bg-background` — primary readable combination
- `text-muted-foreground` on `bg-background` — secondary text (verify contrast!)
- `text-foreground` on `bg-surface` — cards and elevated surfaces
- Never place `text-muted-foreground` on `bg-surface` without verifying the combination meets 4.5:1
- White text on `bg-primary` must meet 4.5:1 — test both light and dark mode values
- **Dark mode is not optional** — every color combination must be tested in both themes
- If text is invisible or hard to read in ANY theme, it's a critical bug — fix immediately

**Testing contrast:**

- Use the Playwright MCP to screenshot in both light (`data-theme="light"`) and dark (`data-theme="dark"`) modes
- Visually inspect every text element against its background
- When in doubt, increase contrast — readability always wins over subtlety

## Typography

- **Font family**: Poppins (already loaded via `next/font/google`)
- **Body text**: `text-base` (16px) minimum — never smaller for readable content
- **Line height**: `leading-relaxed` (1.625) for body paragraphs, `leading-tight` (1.25) for headings
- **Max line width**: `max-w-prose` (65ch) for long-form text — lines longer than 75 characters are hard to read
- **Letter spacing**: Default for body, `tracking-tight` for large headings, `tracking-widest` for eyebrow labels

## Text Alignment and Layout Balance

**Default to left-aligned text for content sections.** Centering paragraph text is the hallmark of amateur design — it signals "I didn't know what else to do." Professional layouts create visual interest through asymmetry and intentional weight distribution.

**When centering works** (short, punchy, symmetrical):

- Hero headlines (single sentence, under ~10 words)
- CTA banners with a single sentence + buttons
- Stat numbers and their labels
- Footer taglines
- Empty states and loading messages

**When centering looks cheap** (never do this):

- Multi-paragraph content sections (About, descriptions, body copy)
- Card grids or lists
- Navigation menus
- Form layouts
- Long-form body copy (multi-sentence or multi-paragraph text blocks)

**What to do instead of centering content sections:**

- Left-align the text with `max-w-prose` for comfortable reading width
- Add visual weight to the right side: an image, illustration, or CTA card
- Use the natural left-to-right reading flow — the eye starts left, so put content there
- Let whitespace on the right breathe rather than forcing symmetry
- For two-element layouts: text left (60-65% width), visual element right (35-40% width)

The goal is **visual balance**, not visual symmetry. A left-aligned text block with a photo on the right is more engaging than the same text centered with nothing around it.

## Card Design

Cards are the primary content container pattern:

- **Background**: `bg-background` (not `bg-surface` — cards should feel elevated)
- **Border**: `border border-border` or `shadow-sm` — never both
- **Border radius**: `rounded-2xl` for cards, `rounded-xl` for smaller elements, `rounded-lg` for buttons
- **Hover state**: `hover:shadow-md transition-shadow duration-200` for interactive cards
- **Padding**: `p-6` minimum, `p-8` for spacious cards
- **Image in card**: Full-bleed at top with `rounded-t-2xl`, or inset with `rounded-xl`

## Button Design

Three tiers of visual importance:

1. **Primary CTA**: `bg-primary text-white rounded-lg px-6 py-3 font-semibold hover:bg-primary/90 transition-colors`
2. **Secondary CTA**: `border border-primary text-primary rounded-lg px-6 py-3 font-semibold hover:bg-primary/10 transition-colors`
3. **Tertiary/Ghost**: `text-primary font-semibold hover:underline`

**Rules:**

- Only one primary CTA per visible screen area
- Buttons must have minimum touch target of 44x44px (WCAG 2.5.8)
- Always include hover and focus states
- Icon + text buttons: icon on the left, `gap-2` between icon and label

## Image Treatment

- **Hero images**: Full-bleed with gradient overlay for text readability. Pattern: `relative overflow-hidden` container + `absolute inset-0 object-cover` image + gradient overlay div
- **Section images**: `rounded-2xl overflow-hidden shadow-lg` for standalone images
- **Card thumbnails**: Consistent aspect ratio (`aspect-video` or `aspect-[4/3]`) with `object-cover`
- **All images**: Must have meaningful `alt` text. Use `next/image` with proper `width`/`height` or `fill`
- **Missing images**: Show a styled placeholder — never a broken image icon or empty space

## Section Patterns

### Hero Sections

- Full-viewport or near-full (`min-h-[60vh]` to `min-h-[80vh]`)
- Background image with dark gradient overlay (`from-foreground/70 via-foreground/50 to-transparent`)
- White text on overlay for maximum contrast
- Clear CTA buttons at the bottom of the hero content

### Feature/Stats Strips

- Full-width colored background (`bg-primary` with white text)
- 3-4 items in a horizontal row (responsive: stack on mobile)
- Short, punchy text — numbers or 2-3 word labels

### Content Sections

- Alternating backgrounds (`bg-background` and `bg-surface`) to create visual separation
- Two-column layouts on desktop, single column on mobile
- Each section has: eyebrow label, heading, body text, optional CTA

### CTA Banners

- Full-width with `bg-primary` or gradient background
- Centered text with 1-2 CTA buttons
- Used between major sections to drive engagement

## Animation and Transitions

- **Hover transitions**: `transition-all duration-200` or `transition-colors duration-200` — never longer than 300ms
- **No jarring animations**: Subtle transforms only (`hover:scale-[1.02]`, `hover:-translate-y-1`)
- **Reduced motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — use `motion-safe:` prefix for animations
- **Page transitions**: Not needed — Next.js App Router handles navigation smoothly
- **Loading states**: Use skeleton screens (pulsing gray boxes) not spinners for content loading

## Navigation

- **Header**: Fixed/sticky, clean, minimal. Logo left, nav center or right, CTA button far right
- **Mobile nav**: Full-screen overlay or slide-in drawer — never a cramped dropdown
- **Active state**: Current page link has `text-primary font-semibold` or underline indicator
- **Footer**: Organized in 3-4 columns, includes all important links, contact info, and legal text
- **Breadcrumbs**: On all inner pages, small and unobtrusive, using `text-muted-foreground`

## Accessibility (Non-Negotiable)

- **Focus indicators**: Visible focus ring on all interactive elements (`focus-visible:ring-2 ring-primary ring-offset-2`)
- **Skip to content**: Link at top of page for keyboard users
- **Semantic HTML**: Use `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`
- **ARIA labels**: On icon-only buttons, decorative elements, and complex widgets
- **Form labels**: Every input must have an associated `<label>` — never placeholder-only
- **Error messages**: Use `role="alert"` with `aria-live="assertive"`
- **Color alone**: Never convey information through color alone — always pair with text or icons

## Performance

- **Core Web Vitals targets**: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- **Images**: Always use `next/image` with proper sizing. Hero images get `priority`. Below-fold images lazy-load.
- **Fonts**: Poppins is loaded via `next/font` with `display: swap` — no FOIT
- **CSS**: Tailwind purges unused styles. Never add custom CSS when Tailwind utilities work.
- **JavaScript**: Minimize client-side JS. Default to Server Components. Only use `'use client'` for interactivity.

## Common Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

- Empty sections with no content — hide them entirely, don't show empty boxes
- Text that disappears in dark/light mode — always test both themes
- Huge whitespace gaps between header and content
- Tiny, hard-to-tap buttons on mobile
- Text overflowing its container at any viewport width
- Images with wrong aspect ratio (stretched or squished)
- Inconsistent border radius (mixing rounded-lg, rounded-xl, rounded-2xl randomly)
- Multiple font families on the same page
- Raw unstyled HTML elements (links without hover states, inputs without focus styles)
- Content that requires horizontal scrolling
- Orphaned single words on their own line in headings (use `text-balance` or `text-pretty`)
- Centered multi-paragraph text blocks — left-align body content, center only short headlines and CTAs
