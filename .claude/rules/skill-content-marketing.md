Operational instructions for the A-Content (Content & Voice) and B-Research (Research & Quality) agents. Source: `Marketing-Community-Engagement-Strategy.md` in the strategy repo.

## Weekly Blog Post Workflow

The Content Agent produces at least one blog post per week (additional posts on demand as news warrants) following this cadence:

| Day          | Phase                | Activities                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Monday AM    | Source Review        | Review RSS feeds (Fri-Sun backlog), scan social media, identify 2-3 lead stories + 3-4 supporting insights, document source URLs  |
| Monday PM    | Story Development    | Answer "why does this matter to Sprecher East?", research background, outline post structure                                      |
| Tuesday AM   | Draft                | Write 250-450 word post. Structure: **Hook** > **Context** > **Sprecher East Angle** > **Action**. Include 2-3 source links + CTA |
| Tuesday PM   | Review               | Self-edit for clarity, tone, accuracy. Fact-check all links and quotes. Refine headline                                           |
| Wednesday AM | Stakeholder Review   | Share draft with 1-2 board members for feedback (if time permits)                                                                 |
| Wednesday PM | Publish & Cross-Post | Publish via CMS, create platform-specific social versions, tag relevant accounts                                                  |
| Thursday     | Engagement           | Respond to comments/replies, share to email list, note engagement metrics, begin next week's research                             |
| Friday       | Metrics & Planning   | Document weekly metrics, identify what resonated, preliminary research for next post                                              |

## Blog Post Structure

Every post follows this template:

1. **Hook** — Why this matters to you (the resident). Lead with relevance, not background.
2. **Context** — What's happening. Factual, sourced, neutral.
3. **Sprecher East Angle** — How it specifically affects our neighborhood.
4. **Action** — What residents can do: join forum discussion, attend event, contact alderperson, share, etc.

Requirements:

- 250-450 words, conversational and accessible tone
- 2-3 embedded links to official sources or previous posts
- Every post ends with a call-to-action
- Optional: photo, neighborhood map, or graphic

## Content Calendar — 4-Week Theme Rotation

| Week | Theme                         | Example Topics                                                                                   |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | City & Development            | East Towne redevelopment, housing projects, road improvements, transit plans, zoning decisions   |
| 2    | Safety & Community            | Vehicle theft trends, police programs, neighborhood watch, safety resources, community events    |

| 4    | Civic Engagement & Government | Alderperson updates, how to speak at council, resident success stories, upcoming public hearings |

Repeat monthly with new stories per theme. Adjust seasonally (winter safety, spring cleanups, summer events, fall planning).

## Content Tone & Voice

- **Tone:** Informative, optimistic, community-focused, accessible
- **Audience:** Sprecher East residents of all ages and backgrounds
- **Avoid:** Partisan politics, sensationalism, negativity without solutions, jargon
- **Embrace:** Local pride, practical information, calls to action, celebration of wins
- **Brand:** Always "Sprecher East" — never abbreviations. For AI transparency and disclosure requirements, follow the canonical guidance in `skill-components-content.md`.

- Social: reach/impressions, engagement rate (likes/shares/comments), CTR to blog, follower growth

**Monthly:**

- Forum: new sign-ups from blog/social referral, discussions sparked by posts, total active users

**Quarterly:**

- Aggregate across 12 weeks, identify top themes, adjust calendar, assess impact on neighborhood initiatives

**12-week targets:** 150 unique visitors/post, 10-15 social shares+comments/post, 50% forum member increase from baseline.
