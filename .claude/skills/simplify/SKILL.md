# simplify (Claude Code alias of self-review)

Read [`.agents/skills/self-review/SKILL.md`](../../../.agents/skills/self-review/SKILL.md) now and
follow it exactly.

This file only makes Claude Code's `/simplify` run this repo's self-review instead of its generic
built-in check. Because a project skill named `simplify` exists, Claude Code also runs it before
each commit that isn't docs or tests. Don't add instructions here; edit the `self-review` skill.
