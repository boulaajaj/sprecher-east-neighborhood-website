description: Post-merge wrap-up, run right after you merge a PR or when someone says the PRs are merged (or "wrapped") — verify each merge, check the deploy and the live site, report server results on the linked issues, close out any Asana task, sync your local main, and report. Use after every merge; never assume a merge happened.

# Wrapped: after a merge

Run this right after you merge a PR, or when someone says the work is merged ("all PRs are
merged", "wrapped", or similar). Verify everything; never assume a merge or a deploy happened.

## 1. Verify the merges

For each PR from the work at hand:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number> -q '.merged_at, .merge_commit_sha'
```

An empty `merged_at` means it isn't merged: say so and stop there for that PR. For a stack, only
part of it may be merged; the PRs still open above are rebased by GitHub
([`stacked-prs`](../stacked-prs/SKILL.md), step 4).

## 2. Check the deploy and the site

A merge to `main` deploys from inside its **CI** run: once `Type-check & Build` passes, CI calls
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, whose jobs show as `Deploy / Preflight`, `Deploy / Build release`
and `Deploy / Deploy` (#245). There is no separate deploy run for a merge. Preflight decides
whether anything deploys: docs-only changes, and commits older than the live one, don't.

1. Find the CI run for the merge commit and wait for it:
   `gh run list --workflow ci.yml --commit <merge_commit_sha>`, then `gh run watch <id>`.
   Where the Actions API is blocked, ask for the deploy's check runs by name (a `main` commit
   collects many other check runs), for example
   `gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<merge_commit_sha>/check-runs?check_name=Deploy%20%2F%20Deploy"`.
   Each check run's `id` is the job id for the next step.
2. Read the annotations (the `::notice` / `::warning` / `::error` lines the scripts print):
   `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/check-runs/<job id>/annotations`.
   - `Deploy / Preflight`: the plan, for example "nothing is deployed" for docs only. When it
     says nothing deploys, `Build release` and `Deploy` are skipped, and that's the result.
   - `Deploy / Build release`: the release built, and its Node version.
   - `Deploy / Deploy`: the server's results ("release … is live", backups, Caddy) and the
     checks from the internet.
3. Open https://sprechereast.com and check the behavior the PRs changed.

Never re-run or start the deploy yourself (it can be started by hand: Actions → Deploy to VPS →
Run workflow, on `main`). A failed deploy gets a new issue and is fixed or reverted through a PR.
Never fix it on the server.

## 3. Close the loop on the issues

- The linked issues close themselves on merge, and `issue-fix-summary.yml` comments on each.
- For server changes (`infra` issues), comment what actually changed on the server, from the
  deploy annotations. Never paste secret values.
- An issue linked with `Part of #N` stays open until its last PR merges.

## 4. Asana (legacy, only if linked)

If a PR body has `Asana: https://app.asana.com/0/0/<task_gid>/f`, add a completion comment with
the PR link to that task and mark it complete
([`asana-workflow.md`](../../../docs/guidelines/asana-workflow.md)). No link, nothing to do.

## 5. Sync and report

```bash
git fetch origin && git switch main && git pull --ff-only origin main
```

Then report briefly: what merged, what deployed, the deploy's result, anything still open or
failing, and anything waiting on the owner (`needs owner`).
