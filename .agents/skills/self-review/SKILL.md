description: Review and clean up your own change before opening or updating a pull request — reuse of existing helpers, code quality, efficiency, the repo's guidelines, and a visual design review for UI changes — then fix what it finds. Use when a change is done and before asking for the independent review.

# Self-review before a PR

The author's own pass over a change. It catches the easy things before the independent review
([`pr-review`](../pr-review/SKILL.md)), and doesn't replace it. Fix every Critical and High finding
before opening the PR.

## 1. Find the change

```bash
git diff <base>...HEAD   # <base>: origin/main, or the branch below for a stacked PR
git diff HEAD            # plus anything not committed yet
```

If there are no changes, review the files you edited in this session.

## 2. Review it four ways

Give each review the full diff. If your tool can run sub-agents, run the four in parallel, one
each; otherwise do them one after another.

### Reuse

1. Search for existing utilities and helpers that could replace new code: the shared folders in
   the [DRY search order](../../../docs/guidelines/development.md#dry--dont-repeat-yourself),
   and files next to the changed ones ([`write-code`](../write-code/SKILL.md) §1).
2. Flag any new function that duplicates an existing one, and name the one to use instead.
3. Flag inline logic an existing utility already covers: hand-rolled string or path handling,
   custom environment checks, ad-hoc type guards.

### Quality

1. **Redundant state**: state that duplicates other state, cached values that could be derived,
   effects that could be direct calls.
2. **Parameter sprawl**: new parameters added instead of generalizing or restructuring.
3. **Copy-paste with slight variation**: near-duplicates that should share one abstraction.
4. **Leaky abstractions**: internals exposed, or module boundaries crossed (see the dependency
   rules in [`docs/architecture/`](../../../docs/architecture/README.md)).
5. **Stringly-typed code**: raw strings where a constant, a string union or a branded type
   already exists.
6. **Guidelines**: anything against [development](../../../docs/guidelines/development.md) or
   [security](../../../docs/guidelines/security.md).
7. **Component API**: a shared component or one meant for reuse follows
   [`vercel-composition-patterns`](../vercel-composition-patterns/SKILL.md) (explicit variants,
   compound parts, no boolean-prop modes).

### Efficiency

1. **Unnecessary work**: repeated computations, file reads or API calls; N+1 queries.
2. **Missed concurrency**: independent operations run one after another.
3. **Hot-path bloat**: new blocking work at startup or on every request or render.
4. **Existence checks before acting** (TOCTOU): do the operation and handle the error instead.
5. **Memory**: unbounded structures, missing cleanup, listener leaks.
6. **Overly broad operations**: reading or loading everything when a part is enough.
7. **React and Next.js**: React and Next.js code is checked against the CRITICAL and HIGH rules of
   [`vercel-react-best-practices`](../vercel-react-best-practices/SKILL.md) (waterfalls, bundle
   size, server-side work, data sent to client components).

### Visual design

Only when the diff touches CSS, Tailwind classes, HTML structure, component markup or image
treatment: follow [`visual-design-review`](../visual-design-review/SKILL.md).

## 3. Fix

Collect the findings and fix each one. If a finding is a false positive or not worth doing, note
it and move on. Then say briefly what you fixed, or that the change was already clean.
