description: How to write, move or refactor code in this repo so it stays modular and easy to read — where it goes (module and layer), reusing what exists, Payload and established libraries before custom code, the dependency rules, tests first, and small files. Use before writing or changing any code under src/, and when reviewing code.

# Write code the Sprecher East way

This is the owner's way of building the site, for every contributor, human or agent. The details
live in [`docs/architecture/`](../../../docs/architecture/README.md); this skill is the short path
through them. Read a reference file below only when the step needs it.

## What the owner asked for

Amine, 2026-10-20 and 2026-10-21 (in the Claude Code sessions that planned #127 and this skill):

- "follow the domain-driven design and bounded context, and avoid all those anti-patterns, like
  modules referencing other modules"
- "very easy to plug with different themes, and very easy to plug with different CMS systems. Our
  business logic and our core things are separated."
- "we don't want to reinvent the wheel or overengineer"
- "very manageable, even for a human to browse and understand the structure of the website just
  from the folder structure"
- From the epics built on his requests (#127, #163): files under 250 lines, each rule
  and component written and tested once and reused, shared components instead of plain HTML
  elements.

Amine, 2026-10-22 (Claude chat, #262): "check the native configuration, check the native
features. And then if they are not there, look for the plugin that is official. If it's not there,
look for a open source plugin [...] If none of it is there, only then we can write the code."

## 1. Find what exists first

Before writing anything, search for it: this module, `src/platform/`, then the template folders
that haven't moved yet. Then go down the ladder: native Payload, Next.js and React features and
config, official plugins, well-established free open-source plugins, and only then our own code.
Record what each step found on the issue before writing custom code. How:
[`references/reuse.md`](references/reuse.md).

## 2. Put it in the right place

```text
src/platform/          1. shared core: lib (pure helpers), ui (primitives with variants),
                          theme (token contract), payload (roles, fields), email, seo, richtext
src/themes/default/    2. the look: token values only
src/modules/<area>/    3. one business area each: events, news, contact, accounts, directory, site
  domain/ use-cases/   4. inside a module: rules and use cases in plain TypeScript,
  data/ cms/ ui/          adapters at the edges, components last; entry files in front
src/app/               routes and composition only: thin pages that call modules
payload.config.ts      CMS composition: registers each module's cms.ts
```

The full "where does it go?" table is in the
[architecture map](../../../docs/architecture/README.md#where-does-it-go). Module skeleton, entry
files, a new feature, a new module: [`references/placement.md`](references/placement.md).

## 3. Keep the dependencies pointing one way

Lint warns on the first four ([`eslint.boundaries.config.mjs`](../../../eslint.boundaries.config.mjs); errors from
#137). Check `overrideAccess`, DTOs, `server-only` and colors yourself; #146 adds a color check
([rules](../../../docs/architecture/README.md#dependency-rules)):

- **Inward only:** `ui/` → `use-cases/` → `domain/`; `data/` and `cms/` → `domain/`. The domain
  imports no framework.
- **No module imports another module.** Two modules meet only where they are composed: a page, a
  layout or the block registry in `src/app/`, or `payload.config.ts` ([0008](../../../docs/architecture/decisions/0008-compose-modules-at-the-app-level.md)).
- **Entry files only:** code outside a module imports its `index.ts`, `server.ts`, `actions.ts` or
  `cms.ts`, never its inner folders. `src/platform/` imports no module.
- **Payload at the edges:** runtime Payload imports only in `data/`, `cms/`, `src/platform/` and
  `payload.config.ts`. Every Local API call sets `overrideAccess`. Use cases return the module's
  own types, not Payload documents.
- **Server code stays on the server:** `data/`, `use-cases/` and `server.ts` start with
  `import 'server-only'`. Client components get plain data as props.
- **No colors in components:** semantic token classes only, so a new theme changes no component.

## 4. Write the test first

For a rule, a guard or a mapper, write the failing test next to the file, then the code. Don't
test Payload, Next.js or styling. How: [`references/tests.md`](references/tests.md).

## 5. Keep it small and plain

- One responsibility per file and function; at most 250 lines per file, functions under about 50.
- Names follow the [conventions](../../../docs/architecture/conventions.md) and the
  [glossary](../../../docs/architecture/glossary.md), so the folder tree reads like the site.
- No abstraction before it pays: an interface only for an outside service, a second
  implementation, or a test double ([conventions](../../../docs/architecture/conventions.md#interfaces-and-adapters)).
- A component takes props for its variants (`cva`) instead of being copied; a second use moves
  it to `src/platform/ui/`.
- Use the shared primitives (`Button`, `Input`, `Label`, `Link`, `Media`), not raw `<button>`,
  `<input>` or `<img>`.

## 6. Before you hand it over

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint && npm test
```

Fix new lint warnings in the files you touched, then run [`self-review`](../self-review/SKILL.md)
(and [`visual-design-review`](../visual-design-review/SKILL.md) when the page looks different).
